- Videos 8-10 min: Pre-roll + 1 mid-roll (at natural break)
- Videos 10+ min: Pre-roll + 2 mid-rolls + post-roll

**Important:** Watch retention graphs - if ads cause drop-offs, adjust placement!

---

## Phase 3: Revenue Growth (Months 5-9)
### Goal: $250-400/Month from Multiple Streams

### Revenue Stream 1: YouTube Ad Revenue

**Expected CPM (Cost Per Mille - per 1,000 views):**
- Pet niche average: $2-5 CPM
- Denver/US audience: Higher CPM (vs international)
- Family-friendly content: Advertiser-friendly = higher CPM

**Calculation Example (Month 6):**
- Monthly views: 30,000
- CPM: $3.50
- Gross revenue: 30,000 ÷ 1,000 × $3.50 = $105
- YouTube takes 45%: $105 × 0.55 = **$57.75 net**

**Growth Tactics:**
- Increase upload frequency (2x → 3x per week if sustainable)
- Create longer videos (8-12 min sweet spot)
- Target high-CPM topics (product reviews, buying guides)
- Optimize for US/Canadian audience (higher ad rates)

### Revenue Stream 2: Affiliate Marketing

**Strategy:**

**Amazon Associates:**
- Feature products genuinely used in videos
- Create "Tulsi's Favorites" Amazon Storefront
- Link in every video + pinned comment
- Expected: $20-50/month (Month 6)

**Chewy Affiliate:**
- Higher commission than Amazon for pet products
- Feature in dedicated review videos
- Create seasonal buying guides
- Expected: $30-80/month (Month 6)

**Direct Brand Partnerships:**
- Reach out to brands you already feature
- Pitch: "We featured your product and it performed well!"
- Negotiate: Free products + affiliate commission or flat fee
- Expected: $0-50/month (Month 6, growing)

**Affiliate Revenue Goal (Month 6):** $50-100/month

### Revenue Stream 3: Lead Generation for Pet Store

**This is unique value for local business!**

**Measurable Impact:**
- Track QR code scans from videos
- Special discount code "TULSI10" for YouTube viewers
- Ask new customers how they found store
- Monitor foot traffic correlation

**Value Calculation:**
If YouTube drives 10 new customers/month:
- Average customer lifetime value: $500-1,000
- Acquisition cost: Essentially zero (content you're creating anyway)
- **Indirect value: $5,000-10,000/month in new business**

**While not direct YouTube revenue, this justifies investment!**

### Revenue Stream 4: Sponsorships (Starting Month 7-9)

**When You're Ready:**
- 5,000+ subscribers
- Consistent 25,000+ monthly views
- Strong engagement (comments, likes, shares)
- Clear audience demographics

**Finding Sponsors:**

1. **Brands You Already Use:**
   - Make list of products you feature regularly
   - Reach out to marketing departments
   - Pitch: Dedicated review video or integration

2. **Affiliate Networks:**
