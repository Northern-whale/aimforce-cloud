**[VISUAL: Exterior of pet store, morning light]**

**TULSI:** [Excited, warm]  
Hi! Hi friends! Oh my goodness, I'm SO excited you're here!

**(pause)**

My name is Tulsi, and welcome to my pet store!

**[VISUAL: Tulsi walks through front door, tail wagging]**

**TULSI:** [Enthusiastic]  
Well, okay, it's not *technically* mine... but I basically live here, so it kind of is!

### INTRODUCING THE STORE (0:20 - 1:15)

**[VISUAL: Wide shot of store interior]**

**TULSI:** [Warm, inviting]  
So this is it - the best pet store in Denver, Colorado! 

**(beat)**

We've got everything a pet could ever want...

**[VISUAL: Quick cuts of different sections]**

**TULSI:** [Building excitement]  
Toys! Treats! Food! Beds! Collars! Bowls! 

**(pause, playful)**

And, *this* is the important part... people who actually CARE about pets!

**[VISUAL: Employee greeting customer warmly]**

**TULSI:** [Thoughtful]  
See, we're not just about selling stuff. We're about helping every pet live their best life.

**(beat, enthusiastic again)**

And that's where I come in!

**[VISUAL: Tulsi walking through aisles]**

**TULSI:** [Friendly]  
My job? Well, I'm kind of the official greeter, product tester, customer helper, and... 

**(playful)**

...professional treat inspector. Someone's gotta make sure everything meets dog standards!

**[VISUAL: Tulsi "inspecting" treat display]**

### A TYPICAL DAY BEGINS (1:15 - 2:30)

**[VISUAL: Clock showing 9:00 AM, store opening]**

**TULSI:** [Energetic]  
Alright, so let me show you what a typical day looks like around here!

**[VISUAL: Tulsi walking to toy section]**

**TULSI:** [Conversational]  
First thing in the morning, I do my rounds. Gotta make sure all the toys are in good shape...

**[VISUAL: Tulsi checking squeaky toys]**

**TULSI:** [Playful]  
*[Squeak sound effect]* 

Yep, that one works!

*[Squeak squeak]*

That one too! 

**(beat, conspiratorial whisper)**

Okay, this part might be more fun than work...

**[VISUAL: First customer enters]**

**TULSI:** [Excited]  
Oh! First customer of the day!

**[VISUAL: Tulsi greeting customer warmly]**

**TULSI:** [Warm]  
Hi! Welcome! Are you looking for something specific, or just browsing?

**(pause, to audience)**

Of course, they can't hear me right now... but my human co-workers translate pretty well!

**[VISUAL: Employee helping customer]**

### HELPING CUSTOMERS (2:30 - 4:00)

**[VISUAL: Customer looking confused in treat aisle]**

**TULSI:** [Helpful]  
Okay, see this? This happens a lot. 

**(pause)**

There are like... a MILLION different treats, and it can be totally overwhelming!

**[VISUAL: Close-up of treat variety]**

**TULSI:** [Thoughtful]  
So here's what I've learned - and I've tested pretty much all of them...

**(beat, playful)**

...for science!

**[VISUAL: Split screen of different treat types]**

**TULSI:** [Educational but friendly]  
First, check the ingredients. You want real meat first on the list - chicken, beef, salmon - not mystery "meat by-products."

**(pause)**

Second, think about what you're using them for. Training? Go small and soft. Chewing? Get something tougher.

**[VISUAL: Show examples of each type]**

**TULSI:** [Warm]  
And third - and this is important - *every dog is different!*

**(beat, sincere)**

What I love might not work for your pup, and that's totally okay. That's why we have samples!

**[VISUAL: Employee giving customer sample treats]**

**TULSI:** [Excited]  
Oh! Speaking of customers...

**[VISUAL: Puppy enters with owner]**

**TULSI:** [Maximum excitement]  
PUPPY ALERT! PUPPY ALERT!

**(pause, composing herself)**

Okay, okay... stay professional, Tulsi...

**(beat, failing)**

Oh my gosh, it's SO CUTE!

**[VISUAL: Tulsi gently meeting puppy]**

**TULSI:** [Sweet, talking to puppy]  
Hi there, little one! First time at the pet store?

**(pause, warm)**

It's a lot, I know. But you're going to love it here!

**[VISUAL: Puppy playing with toy]**

**TULSI:** [To audience, happy]  
This is honestly my favorite part. Meeting new pet friends and seeing them discover all the fun stuff!

---

### LUNCHTIME (4:00 - 4:45)

**[VISUAL: Clock showing 12:30 PM]**

**TULSI:** [Casual]  
Alright, lunchtime! Even professional product testers need a break!

**[VISUAL: Tulsi in back room, eating lunch]**

**TULSI:** [Conversational]  
So while I'm munching, let me tell you why I love this job so much...

**(pause, thoughtful)**

Every single day, I get to help make pets happy. Whether it's finding the perfect toy, recommending a better food, or just making someone feel welcome...

**(beat, sincere)**

...it matters, you know?

**[VISUAL: Montage of happy customers from earlier]**

**TULSI:** [Warm]  
Plus, I get to meet the BEST animals. Dogs, cats, birds, rabbits, fish... even had a ferret in here last week!

**(playful)**

Ferrets are *weird*, by the way. But in a good way!

---

### AFTERNOON RUSH (4:45 - 5:45)

**[VISUAL: Store getting busier]**

**TULSI:** [Energetic]  
Okay, afternoon rush incoming! This is when everyone stops by after work!

**[VISUAL: Multiple customers browsing]**

**TULSI:** [Excited narration over montage]  
We've got someone shopping for cat litter...

Someone comparing dog foods...

Someone looking for a birthday gift for their guinea pig... 

**(pause, delighted)**

Yes, guinea pig birthdays are a thing, and they're ADORABLE!

**[VISUAL: Interesting customer interaction]**

**TULSI:** [Warm]  
Oh, this is Sarah! She comes in every week for her bird, Mango.

**(beat, friendly)**

We've gotten to know a lot of regulars, and they're basically family now!

**[VISUAL: Employee chatting with Sarah]**

### PRODUCT TESTING (5:45 - 6:30)

**[VISUAL: New shipment arrives]**

**TULSI:** [Curious]  
Ooh, new shipment! Let's see what came in today...

**[VISUAL: Opening boxes]**

**TULSI:** [Excited]  
New squeaky toys! Okay, you KNOW I have to test these!

**[VISUAL: Tulsi testing toys enthusiastically]**

**TULSI:** [Playful, between squeaks]  
This one... *[squeak]* ...good squeak...

This one... *[squeak squeak]* ...GREAT squeak!

And this one... *[squeak]*

**(pause, impressed)**

...paw-sitively perfect!

**[VISUAL: Tulsi gives "four paws up" gesture with editing]**

**TULSI:** [To camera, satisfied]  
Quality control: Complete!

### CLOSING TIME (6:30 - 7:15)

**[VISUAL: Sun setting, customers leaving]**

**TULSI:** [Winding down]  
Alright, closing time! 

**[VISUAL: Helping last customers check out]**

**TULSI:** [Warm]  
Thanks for coming in! Have a great night!

**[VISUAL: Lights dimming, Tulsi walking through quiet store]**

**TULSI:** [Reflective, slower pace]  
You know what? Days like this remind me how lucky I am.

**(pause)**

I get to spend every day surrounded by people who love animals as much as I do.

**(beat)**

I help pets find what they need...

**[VISUAL: Flashback clips of moments from the day]**

**TULSI:** [Sincere]  
I meet amazing friends...

And I learn something new literally every single day.

**(pause, to camera)**

Plus, unlimited toy testing. Can't beat that!

### CLOSING (7:15 - 7:45)

**[VISUAL: Tulsi by front door]**

**TULSI:** [Warm, friendly]  
So that's a day in my life at the pet store!

**(beat)**

I'm so glad you joined me today, and I hope you'll come back!

**[VISUAL: Tulsi wagging tail]**

**TULSI:** [Excited]  
Next time, I'm testing out ALL the treats in the store to find my top 5 favorites!

**(pause, playful)**

It's a tough job, but someone's gotta do it!

**[VISUAL: Tulsi heading out]**

**TULSI:** [Sign-off, cheerful]  
Thanks for hanging out with me, friends! If you're ever in Denver, come visit us!

**(beat)**

See you next adventure! 

**(pause)**

Keep those tails wagging!
