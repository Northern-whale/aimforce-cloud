## SCRIPT

### OPENING (0:00 - 0:30)

**[VISUAL: Cozy setting, soft lighting, Tulsi settled in comfortable spot]**

**TULSI:** [Warm, inviting, slower pace]  
Hey friends! Come get cozy!

**(pause)**

Today's episode is a little different. It's storytime!

**[VISUAL: Title card with storybook aesthetic - "STORYTIME: HOW I BECAME MASCOT"]**

**TULSI:**  
I'm going to tell you the story of how I became the mascot of this pet store.

**(beat, warm)**

So settle in, and let me take you back...

### THE BEGINNING (0:30 - 2:00)

**[VISUAL: Soft focus, dreamy quality with photos/footage]**

**TULSI:** [Nostalgic]  
Three years ago, I was just a regular customer.

Well, I wasn't even the customer - my mom was!

**[VISUAL: Old photos of younger Tulsi]**

**TULSI:**  
I was a year old, kind of shy, and honestly? A little anxious about new places.

**(pause, remembering)**

My mom would bring me here every week to pick up my food, and I would hide behind her legs the whole time!

**[VISUAL: Recreated scene or actual old footage if available]**

**TULSI:**  
But there was this one employee - her name was Jessica - and she never pushed me.

**(beat, warm)**

She'd just quietly put a treat on the floor a few feet away, then step back.

**[VISUAL: Treat on floor]**

**TULSI:**  
At first, I wouldn't take it. Too scared!

But week after week, she kept doing it.

**(pause, emotional)**

And slowly... I started trusting her.

---

### THE TURNING POINT (2:00 - 3:45)

**TULSI:** [Building emotion]  
Then one day, something happened.

**[VISUAL: Setting the scene]**

**TULSI:**  
A little kid came into the store - maybe 5 years old - with his dad.

The kid LOVED dogs, but he was... a lot. Really loud, really energetic, you know?

**(beat)**

And there was this other dog in the store - a rescue who'd just been adopted - and she got scared by the commotion.

**[VISUAL: Tense scene recreation]**

**TULSI:**  
She started barking, backing into a corner, totally overwhelmed.

Everyone was trying to help, but it was making it worse.

**(pause, remembering)**

And I... I don't know what came over me...

**[VISUAL: Tulsi approaching calmly]**

**TULSI:**  
I walked over slowly. Sat down next to her. Just... calm.

**(beat, gentle)**

I didn't crowd her. Didn't force anything. Just sat there.

**[VISUAL: Emotional scene]**

**TULSI:**  
And after a minute, she stopped barking.

She looked at me, sniffed me, and then... she just relaxed.

**(pause, emotional)**

Jessica saw the whole thing.

### THE OFFER (3:45 - 5:00)

**TULSI:** [Warm memory]  
After that day, Jessica talked to my mom.

**[VISUAL: Conversation recreation]**

**TULSI:**  
She said, "Tulsi has such a calming presence. Would you ever consider bringing her in more often? She could help socialize nervous dogs!"

**(beat, excited memory)**

And my mom said yes!

**[VISUAL: Montage of early days]**

**TULSI:**  
So I started coming in three days a week.

At first, I just hung out, greeted customers, met other pets...

**(pause, proud)**

But then I started... kind of working!

**[VISUAL: Various helping scenes]**

**TULSI:**  
I'd help nervous dogs feel comfortable.

I'd demonstrate toys for customers who weren't sure what to buy.

I'd quality-test treats - that's still my favorite job!

**(beat, happy)**

And somewhere along the way... I became part of the family!

### BECOMING MASCOT (5:00 - 6:00)

**TULSI:** [Proud memory]  
About six months in, the store owner - Sarah - had an idea.

**[VISUAL: Meeting/discussion]**

**TULSI:**  
She said, "What if we make Tulsi our official mascot? Put her picture on the website, social media, maybe even our sign?"

**(pause, touched)**

And everyone agreed!

**[VISUAL: Photos being taken, logo designs]**

**TULSI:**  
They did a whole photoshoot! I got a bandana with the store logo!

My picture went up on the window!

**(beat, amazed)**

I even have a little bio on the website!

**[VISUAL: Website/social media presence]**

**TULSI:**  
But the best part?

The community response!

**[VISUAL: Customer reactions, kids excited to see Tulsi]**

**TULSI:**  
Kids would come in specifically to see me!

People would bring their nervous dogs to meet me!

**(pause, warm)**

I went from being the scared dog hiding behind my mom...

To being the one helping other dogs feel brave!

---

### THE LESSON (6:00 - 6:45)

**TULSI:** [Reflective, meaningful]  
You know what I learned from all this?

**(pause, thoughtful)**

Sometimes the things we're scared of become the things we're meant to do.

**[VISUAL: Montage of Tulsi helping others]**

**TULSI:**  
I was terrified of this place at first.

But with patience, kindness, and time...

It became my home.

**(beat, warm)**

And now I get to help other scared dogs find their courage too.

**[VISUAL: Heartwarming scene of Tulsi with nervous dog who then relaxes]**

**TULSI:**  
That's pretty special, isn't it?

---

### CLOSING (6:45 - 7:15)

**[VISUAL: Back to cozy setting]**

**TULSI:** [Warm, content]  
So that's my story!

From scared customer to official mascot!

**(pause, grateful)**

I'm so thankful to Jessica for her patience, to Sarah for believing in me, and to my mom for bringing me here in the first place!

**(beat, to audience)**

And I'm thankful to all of you for joining me on these adventures!

**TULSI:** [Sign-off]  
Next week: Something special! But it's a surprise!

Keep those tails wagging, friends!

Good night! 🐾
