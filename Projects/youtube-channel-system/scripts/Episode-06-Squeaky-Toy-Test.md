### SQUEAK QUALITY ANALYSIS (4:45 - 5:45)

**TULSI:** [Analytical]  
Now let's talk squeak quality!

**[VISUAL: Sound wave graphics]**

**TULSI:**  
Some squeaks are high-pitched... *[High squeak!]*

Some are low... *[Low squeak!]*

Some are SUPER loud... *[LOUD SQUEAK!]*

And some barely make a sound... *[Tiny squeak!]*

**(pause, thoughtful)**

Which is best? Depends on your human!

If they work from home? Maybe go quieter!

If you're playing outside? LOUD is fun!
