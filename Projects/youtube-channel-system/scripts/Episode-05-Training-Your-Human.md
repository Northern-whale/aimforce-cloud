## SCRIPT

### OPENING (0:00 - 0:15)

**TULSI:** [Playful, conspiratorial]  
Okay dogs, gather 'round! Today's episode is for US!

**(pause, comedic)**

I'm going to teach you how to train your human!

**[VISUAL: Title - "HOW TO TRAIN YOUR HUMAN"]**

**TULSI:**  
They think they're training us... but who REALLY runs the house?

---

### TIP #1: THE BREAKFAST ROUTINE (0:15 - 1:30)

**TULSI:** [Instructional]  
Tip number one: Establishing the breakfast routine!

**[VISUAL: Morning scene]**

**TULSI:**  
Now, humans can be VERY slow in the morning. So here's what you do...

**(beat)**

Step one: Sit by their bed at exactly 6:30 AM. Stare intensely.

**[VISUAL: Demonstration]**

**TULSI:**  
Step two: If they don't wake up, add a gentle paw tap.

**(pause)**

Step three: Escalate to licking their face if necessary!

**[VISUAL: Human waking up]**

**TULSI:** [Triumphant]  
Within one week, they'll be trained to wake up at the same time every day! Consistency is key!

**(beat, wise)**

Remember: YOU set the schedule, not them!

---

### TIP #2: THE TREAT SIGNAL (1:30 - 2:45)

**TULSI:** [Educational]  
Tip two: The treat signal!

**[VISUAL: Treat jar on counter]**

**TULSI:**  
First, identify where they keep the treats. Usually a jar or cupboard.

**(pause)**

Now, every time you do something they like - sit, stay, come when called - immediately look at the treat location!

**[VISUAL: Demonstration]**

**TULSI:**  
They'll start to make the connection: "Good behavior equals treat!"

**(beat, playful)**

But here's the trick - sometimes do good behavior WITHOUT being asked, then stare at treats!

**[VISUAL: Sitting automatically, looking at treats]**

**TULSI:**  
They'll be SO impressed by your "initiative" that they'll give you treats MORE often!

**(pause, satisfied)**

You've now trained them to reward you for existing! Well done!

---

### TIP #3: THE TOY SELECTION (2:45 - 4:00)

**TULSI:** [Informative]  
Tip three: Teaching them which toys you actually like!

**[VISUAL: Various dog toys]**

**TULSI:**  
Humans have terrible taste in toys. They'll buy you something with feathers or weird textures...

**(beat)**

Here's how to fix this:

**[VISUAL: Ignoring bad toy]**

**TULSI:**  
Step one: Completely ignore the toy you don't like. Don't even look at it!

**[VISUAL: Enthusiastic with good toy]**

**TULSI:**  
Step two: When they bring out a toy you DO like, go CRAZY! Maximum enthusiasm!

**(pause)**

Zoomies, tail wags, the works!

**[VISUAL: Happy playing]**

**TULSI:**  
Within a few tries, they'll learn your preferences and only buy the good stuff!

**(beat, wise)**

Training through positive reinforcement - works both ways!

### TIP #4: THE WALK SCHEDULE (4:00 - 5:00)

**TULSI:** [Strategic]  
Tip four: Optimizing walk time!

**[VISUAL: Leash by door]**

**TULSI:**  
The key is consistency. Pick your ideal walk time - let's say 4 PM.

**[VISUAL: Clock showing 4 PM]**

**TULSI:**  
Every day at 3:55, start your walk routine:

- Sit by the door
- Stare at the leash
- Optional: gentle whine
- Look at human, look at leash, repeat

**[VISUAL: Demonstration]**

**TULSI:**  
After two weeks of this, their internal clock will sync with yours!

**(beat, triumphant)**

They'll automatically grab the leash at 4 PM without you even asking!

---

### TIP #5: EMOTIONAL SUPPORT TRAINING (5:00 - 6:15)

**TULSI:** [Warm, sincere]  
Tip five: This one's important - teaching them they can rely on you!

**[VISUAL: Human looking stressed]**

**TULSI:** [Thoughtful]  
Humans have hard days. When you notice your human is sad or stressed...

**[VISUAL: Tulsi approaching gently]**

**TULSI:**  
Approach quietly. Rest your head on their lap. Make eye contact.

**(pause, gentle)**

You're training them to trust that you'll always be there.

**[VISUAL: Human petting dog, both calm]**

**TULSI:** [Sincere]  
And honestly? This isn't really training. This is just... being there for each other.

**(beat, warm)**

Which is what it's all about, isn't it?

---

### CLOSING (6:15 - 6:45)

**TULSI:** [Playful again]  
So there you have it! Five tips to train your human!

**(beat, comedic)**

Breakfast routine, treat signals, toy selection, walk schedules, and emotional support!

**(pause, sincere)**

But real talk? Training is a two-way street. They're teaching us, we're teaching them.

And together, we make a pretty great team!

**TULSI:** [Sign-off]  
Next week: Testing squeaky toys! SO many squeaky toys!

See you next adventure, friends! 🐾
