## SCRIPT

### OPENING (0:00 - 0:25)

**[VISUAL: Tulsi surrounded by treat bags]**

**TULSI:** [Excited, conspiratorial]  
Okay friends, can I tell you a secret?

**(dramatic pause)**

I may have... *possibly*... tested every single treat in this store.

**(beat, playful)**

All hundred-something of them.

**[VISUAL: Quick montage of Tulsi "testing" various treats]**

**TULSI:** [Proudly]  
And you know what? It was delicious... I mean, *educational!*

**[VISUAL: Title card]**  
**TEXT ON SCREEN:** "TULSI'S TOP 5 FAVORITE TREATS!"

**TULSI:** [Enthusiastic]  
Today, I'm sharing my top 5 favorite treats EVER! Let's dig in!

### #5: WILD-CAUGHT SALMON JERKY (0:25 - 1:45)

**[VISUAL: #5 text animation]**

**TULSI:** [Announcer voice, playful]  
Coming in at number five... *drumroll please*...

**[VISUAL: Salmon jerky bag reveal]**

**TULSI:** [Excited]  
Wild-Caught Salmon Jerky!

**[VISUAL: Close-up of treat]**

**TULSI:** [Informative]  
Okay, so first things first - let's talk ingredients!

**[VISUAL: Ingredient list zoom]**

**TULSI:** [Reading, impressed]  
Ingredients: Wild-caught salmon, coconut glycerin, and... that's it!

**(pause, emphatic)**

TWO ingredients! You know what that means? No weird stuff! No mystery powders! Just *fish!*

**[VISUAL: Tulsi examining treat]**

**TULSI:** [Descriptive]  
These are strips - kind of chewy, not too hard. Perfect for dogs with sensitive teeth.

**(beat)**

And the smell? Oh my goodness...

**[VISUAL: Tulsi sniffing dramatically]**

**TULSI:** [Blissful]  
*[Deep sniff sound]*

It's like the ocean had a delicious baby with a treat factory!

**[VISUAL: Tulsi eating piece]**

**TULSI:** [Savoring, talking while chewing]  
*Mmmmm*... 

**(pause, thoughtful)**

Okay, here's the thing though - these are STRONG smelling. Like, really strong.

**(beat, honest)**

So if you're going on a long car ride? Maybe keep these in a sealed bag. Trust me on this one.

**[VISUAL: Graphic showing info]**

**TEXT ON SCREEN:**  
"✓ Only 2 ingredients  
✓ Soft & chewy  
✓ High protein  
⚠ Very strong smell!"

**TULSI:** [Summary]  
Perfect for: Training, picky eaters, dogs who love fish!

Price: About $12 for a 4oz bag.

**(beat)**

Paw rating? Four out of five paws! 🐾🐾🐾🐾

Would be five, but that smell is *intense!*

### #4: PEANUT BUTTER CRUNCH COOKIES (1:45 - 3:00)

**[VISUAL: #4 text animation]**

**TULSI:** [Upbeat]  
Number four! Peanut Butter Crunch Cookies!

**[VISUAL: Cookie bag and treats]**

**TULSI:** [Nostalgic]  
Oh man, these take me back. These were actually the first treat I ever had when I started working here!

**[VISUAL: Flashback-style footage]**

**TULSI:** [Warm]  
And I've been hooked ever since!

**[VISUAL: Ingredient check]**

**TULSI:** [Reading]  
Ingredients: Oat flour, peanut butter - the real kind, no xylitol, we checked! - honey, eggs, and cinnamon.

**(pause, approving)**

All things I can actually pronounce! That's a good sign!

**[VISUAL: Cookie close-up]**

**TULSI:** [Descriptive]  
These are crunchy - like, *actually* crunchy. You know how some "crunchy" treats are basically just... hard? These have a satisfying *crack* when you bite them!

**[VISUAL: Tulsi crunching cookie - sound effect]**

**TULSI:** [Satisfied]  
*[Crunch sound]*

Hear that? That's the sound of happiness!

**[VISUAL: Size comparison with quarter]**

**TULSI:** [Helpful]  
Size-wise, these are about as big as a quarter. So they're great for medium to large dogs. If you have a tiny pup, you might want to break them in half.

**(pause, practical)**

Also! They're bakery-style, so they have a shorter shelf life than super processed treats. Use them within a month of opening.

**[VISUAL: Happy dog eating cookie]**

**TULSI:** [Enthusiastic]  
But honestly? They never last that long anyway because they're SO good!

**[VISUAL: Info graphic]**

**TEXT ON SCREEN:**  
"✓ Natural ingredients  
✓ Satisfying crunch  
✓ Made in USA  
⚠ Not for tiny dogs (too big)"

**TULSI:** [Summary]  
Perfect for: Crunchy snackers, peanut butter lovers, reward treats!

Price: $8 for about 20 cookies.

Paw rating? Four out of five! 🐾🐾🐾🐾

### #3: FREEZE-DRIED CHICKEN BITES (3:00 - 4:15)

**[VISUAL: #3 text animation, dramatic music]**

**TULSI:** [Building suspense]  
Alright, now we're getting into the *really* good stuff...

**[VISUAL: Freeze-dried chicken reveal]**

**TULSI:** [Excited]  
Number three: Freeze-Dried Chicken Bites!

**[VISUAL: Opening package]**

**TULSI:** [Informative, impressed]  
Okay, can we talk about freeze-drying for a second? Because it's kind of genius!

**(pause, explaining)**

They take real, raw chicken breast - like, the stuff YOU would eat - and they freeze-dry it. That means they remove all the water but keep all the nutrients and flavor!

**[VISUAL: Ingredient list]**

**TULSI:** [Reading]  
Ingredients: Chicken breast.

**(beat, emphatic)**

That's it! ONE ingredient! It's literally just chicken!

**[VISUAL: Tulsi examining treats]**

**TULSI:** [Descriptive]  
These are small cubes - about the size of a pea. They're light and airy, and they kind of dissolve in your mouth...

**[VISUAL: Tulsi eating one, extreme close-up reaction]**

**TULSI:** [Blissful]  
*Mmmmmmmmm...*

**(pause, gathering composure)**

Okay, I need a moment. That's SO good!

**(beat, to camera)**

And this is why I tested a hundred treats. For moments like THIS!

**[VISUAL: Using treats for training]**

**TULSI:** [Practical]  
Now, these are AMAZING for training because they're small, they're high-value - meaning dogs go CRAZY for them - and you can fit like a million in your pocket!

**(pause, enthusiastic)**

Okay, not a million. But a lot!

**[VISUAL: Price tag]**

**TULSI:** [Honest]  
Fair warning: These are pricey. We're talking $15 for a 3oz bag.

**(beat, justifying)**

But here's the thing - you only need a tiny piece at a time. So one bag lasts way longer than you'd think!

**[VISUAL: Comparison with cheaper treats]**

**TULSI:** [Thoughtful]  
Plus, it's pure protein. No fillers, no junk. Just meat. So you're really getting what you pay for!

**[VISUAL: Info graphic]**

**TEXT ON SCREEN:**  
"✓ 100% chicken  
✓ Perfect for training  
✓ High protein  
⚠ More expensive"

**TULSI:** [Summary]  
Perfect for: Training, picky eaters, high-value rewards!

Paw rating? Four and a half paws! 🐾🐾🐾🐾✨

Would be five, but that price though!

### #2: SWEET POTATO CHEWS (4:15 - 5:30)

**[VISUAL: #2 text, excitement building]**

**TULSI:** [Dramatic]  
We're almost at number one, but first...

**[VISUAL: Sweet potato chews reveal]**

**TULSI:** [Warm, genuine]  
Number two: Sweet Potato Chews!

And okay, this might surprise you because they're simple... but sometimes simple is perfect!

**[VISUAL: Chew close-up]**

**TULSI:** [Informative]  
These are literally just sweet potatoes that have been sliced and slow-baked until they're chewy.

**[VISUAL: Ingredient label]**

**TULSI:** [Reading]  
Ingredients: Sweet potatoes.

**(pause, smiling)**

Yep, you heard right! ONE ingredient, and it's a vegetable!

**[VISUAL: Tulsi chewing on one]**

**TULSI:** [Thoughtful]  
Now, these are different from the other treats because they're more of a *chew* than a quick snack. You don't gobble these down - you savor them!

**(beat, satisfied)**

They're chewy, slightly sweet, and they keep you busy for like 10-15 minutes!

**[VISUAL: Health benefits graphic]**

**TULSI:** [Educational]  
Plus, sweet potatoes are really good for you! They have fiber, vitamins, and they're easy on sensitive tummies.

**(pause, personal)**

I actually have a slightly sensitive stomach - don't tell anyone - and these never bother me!

**[VISUAL: Different sizes available]**

**TULSI:** [Helpful]  
They come in different sizes too! Little strips for small dogs, big chunks for the chewers!

**[VISUAL: Dog happily chewing]**

**TULSI:** [Enthusiastic]  
And here's a bonus - they're great for dogs who are watching their weight! Low calorie, super filling!

**(beat, playful)**

Not that I'm watching my weight or anything... I'm just naturally athletic!

**[VISUAL: Info graphic]**

**TEXT ON SCREEN:**  
"✓ Single ingredient  
✓ Long-lasting chew  
✓ Good for sensitive stomachs  
✓ Low calorie"

**TULSI:** [Summary]  
Perfect for: Chewers, sensitive dogs, weight management!

Price: $10 for a big bag - great value!

Paw rating? FIVE PAWS! 🐾🐾🐾🐾🐾

I love these so much!

### #1: BACON-WRAPPED DENTAL STICKS (5:30 - 6:45)

**[VISUAL: Drumroll, #1 animation, confetti]**

**TULSI:** [Maximum excitement]  
And finally... *drumroll*...

The number ONE treat...

The treat I would choose if I could only have one treat for the rest of my life...

**[VISUAL: Bacon dental sticks - dramatic reveal]**

**TULSI:** [Reverent]  
Bacon-Wrapped Dental Sticks!

**(pause, blissful)**

*[Chef's kiss motion]*

Perfection!

**[VISUAL: Close-up of treat]**

**TULSI:** [Enthusiastic]  
Okay, so imagine this: A dental stick - you know, the kind that cleans your teeth while you chew?

**(beat)**

But then... THEN... they wrap it in BACON!

**(pause, amazed)**

Who thought of this?! They deserve a Nobel Prize!

**[VISUAL: Tulsi with treat]**

**TULSI:** [Descriptive]  
So the inside is this crunchy, ridged stick that helps scrape plaque off your teeth...

**[VISUAL: Close-up of ridges]**

**TULSI:** [Continuing]  
And the outside is real bacon! Not bacon flavor - REAL. BACON!

**[VISUAL: Tulsi eating one, pure joy]**

**TULSI:** [Blissful, slow]  
*Mmmmmmmmmm...*

**(long pause)**

I'm sorry, I just... I need a moment with this...

**(beat, recovering)**

Okay, where was I? Oh right - WHY these are number one!

**[VISUAL: Split screen - benefits list]**

**TULSI:** [Counting off]  
One: They taste AMAZING!

Two: They clean your teeth! Like, actually clean them! My teeth feel so smooth after!

Three: They're long-lasting! Takes me like 20 minutes to finish one!

Four: The bacon makes them irresistible! Even the pickiest eaters love these!

**[VISUAL: Ingredient check]**

**TULSI:** [Informative]  
Ingredients: Dental cleaning base - plant-based fibers, bacon, natural smoke flavor, and some vitamins.

**(pause, honest)**

Okay, so these aren't as "pure" as some of the others. But they're functional - they actually clean your teeth - AND delicious!

**[VISUAL: Before/after teeth comparison]**

**TULSI:** [Testimonial]  
My vet actually said my teeth look great, and I genuinely think it's because of these!

**[VISUAL: Price and size info]**

**TULSI:** [Practical]  
They're about $12 for a pack of 10. So like $1.20 per treat.

**(beat)**

A little pricey for a daily treat, but perfect for special occasions or weekly dental care!

**[VISUAL: Info graphic]**

**TEXT ON SCREEN:**  
"✓ Cleans teeth  
✓ BACON!!!  
✓ Long-lasting  
✓ Vet-approved  
✓ Irresistible taste"

**TULSI:** [Summary, emphatic]  
Perfect for: EVERYONE! Seriously, every dog I know loves these!

Paw rating? SIX PAWS! 🐾🐾🐾🐾🐾🐾

**(pause, playful)**

Yes, I know I only have four paws. These get a bonus two for being THAT good!

### HONORABLE MENTIONS (6:45 - 7:15)

**[VISUAL: Quick montage of other treats]**

**TULSI:** [Quick pace]  
Quick honorable mentions before we wrap up!

**[VISUAL: Flash each treat for 3 seconds]**

**TULSI:** [Listing]  
Bully sticks - classic, long-lasting, but VERY stinky!

Cheese crisps - great for lactose-tolerant pups!

Greenies - fresh breath, good dental care!

And beef liver - high value, but an acquired taste!
