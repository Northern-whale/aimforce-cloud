## SCRIPT

### OPENING (0:00 - 0:30)

**TULSI:** [Warm, meaningful tone]  
Today's episode is really special, friends.

**[VISUAL: Tulsi with customer Lisa and her dog Max]**

**TULSI:**  
I want to introduce you to Lisa and her dog, Max.

**(pause, emotional)**

They have an incredible story about how the right products - and a lot of love - changed everything.

**[VISUAL: Title card - "MAX'S TRANSFORMATION"]**

**TULSI:**  
Grab some tissues. This one's a tear-jerker!

### MEETING MAX & THE PROBLEM (0:30 - 2:00)

**[VISUAL: Max now - healthy, happy dog]**

**TULSI:**  
This is Max today - happy, healthy, full of energy!

**(beat)**

But six months ago? Max was struggling.

**[VISUAL: Photos of Max at his worst - with owner permission]**

**LISA:** [Customer speaking on camera, emotional]  
When I first adopted Max from the shelter, he was in rough shape.

His coat was dull, he had skin issues, he barely had energy to walk...

**(pause, tearful)**

The vet said he was malnourished and had food allergies. Nothing serious, but he'd been eating the wrong food for so long.

**[VISUAL: Vet reports, documentation]**

**TULSI:** [Compassionate]  
That must have been so scary.

**LISA:**  
It was! I didn't know where to start! The vet gave me a list of things to avoid, but there are SO many dog foods...

I felt overwhelmed!

---

### FINDING HELP (2:00 - 3:30)

**LISA:**  
Then I came here. I think I looked pretty desperate!

**[VISUAL: Recreated scene of Lisa entering store]**

**TULSI:**  
I remember! You had a notebook with all the vet's notes!

**LISA:**  
Yes! And Jessica and Tulsi - well, the whole team really - they spent almost an hour with me!

**[VISUAL: Discussion at food aisle]**

**TULSI:** [Narrating]  
We went through ingredients together.

**LISA:**  
They showed me how to read labels, which ingredients to avoid for allergies, what to look for in quality food...

**(beat, grateful)**

They didn't just hand me the most expensive food and say "buy this."

They educated me!

**[VISUAL: Comparing foods, reading labels together]**

**TULSI:**  
We found a limited-ingredient salmon and sweet potato formula - no chicken, no grains, nothing on Max's allergy list!

**LISA:**  
And they suggested supplements too - omega oils for his coat, probiotics for digestion.

### THE TRANSFORMATION (3:30 - 5:00)

**LISA:**  
Within two weeks, I saw changes.

**[VISUAL: Timeline with photos]**

**LISA:**  
Week 1: He had more energy! Actually wanted to play!

Week 2: His scratching reduced by half!

Week 4: His coat started getting shiny!

**(pause, emotional)**

Month 3: The vet said he looked like a completely different dog!

**[VISUAL: Before and after photos side by side]**

**TULSI:** [Emotional]  
Look at that difference!

**LISA:**  
I know! It's incredible!

**[VISUAL: Max playing energetically now]**

**LISA:**  
Now he runs, plays fetch, goes on hikes with me...

**(beat, tearful happy)**

He's living his best life!

**TULSI:**  
That's what it's all about!

---

### WHAT MADE THE DIFFERENCE (5:00 - 6:00)

**TULSI:**  
Lisa, what do you think made the biggest difference?

**LISA:** [Thoughtful]  
Honestly? It wasn't just the products - though they're great!

**(pause)**

It was the CARE. The time people took to really understand what Max needed.

**[VISUAL: Team helping Lisa]**

**LISA:**  
I've been to big pet store chains where employees don't have time or don't know the products well.

**(beat)**

But here? Everyone knows the products inside and out. They care about getting it RIGHT!

**TULSI:** [Humble]  
That means so much to hear!

**LISA:**  
And you follow up! Every time I come in, you ask how Max is doing!

You remember us!

**(pause, emotional)**

That's rare. That's special.

---

### MAX'S MESSAGE (6:00 - 6:30)

**TULSI:** [Playful]  
Max, anything you want to say?

**MAX:** [Voiceover - energetic, happy voice]  
Yeah! Thank you for helping my mom help me!

**(beat, silly)**

Also, those salmon treats you recommended? Those are AMAZING!

**TULSI:** [Laughing]  
Right?! I tested those myself!

**MAX:**  
Quality control approved!

---

### CLOSING (6:30 - 7:15)

**[VISUAL: Tulsi with Lisa and Max]**

**TULSI:** [Sincere]  
Thank you, Lisa and Max, for sharing your story!

**LISA:**  
Thank you for everything you've done for us!

**[VISUAL: Happy moments montage]**

**TULSI:** [To camera, meaningful]  
Friends, this is why we do what we do.

It's not just about selling products - it's about changing lives!

**(pause)**

If your pet is struggling with something, please don't give up!

Talk to your vet, do research, ask for help!

**(beat, encouraging)**

The right solution is out there!

**TULSI:** [Sign-off]
