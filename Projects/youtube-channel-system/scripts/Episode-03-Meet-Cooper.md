### INTRODUCING COOPER (0:20 - 1:20)

**[VISUAL: Cooper close-up, happy and friendly]**

**TULSI:** [Warm, introducing]  
Friends, this is Cooper! He's a Golden Retriever, he's four years old, and he is one of the goodest boys I know!

**[VISUAL: Cooper wagging tail]**

**TULSI:** [Playful]  
Cooper, welcome back to the show!

**COOPER:** [Voiceover - friendly, slightly goofy voice]  
Thanks, Tulsi! I'm so happy to be here!

**TULSI:** [To audience]  
Cooper and his mom Sarah have been coming to our store for, what, like two years now?

**COOPER:**  
Two and a half! Since I was a puppy!

**[VISUAL: Throwback photo of puppy Cooper in store]**

**TULSI:** [Nostalgic]  
Aww, look at baby Cooper! You were SO tiny!

**COOPER:** [Playfully defensive]  
Hey, I was big for my age!

**TULSI:** [Laughing]  
You were adorable!

**[VISUAL: Present-day Cooper - much bigger]**

**TULSI:** [Conversational]  
So Cooper, tell everyone - why do you love coming to the pet store?

**COOPER:** [Enthusiastic]  
Oh man, where do I even start? The treats, the toys, the smells... 

**(beat, sincere)**

But honestly? Seeing you, Tulsi. You always make me feel special!

**TULSI:** [Touched]  
Aww, Cooper! You ARE special!

### COOPER'S STORY (1:20 - 2:40)

**[VISUAL: Photos from Cooper as puppy to now]**

**TULSI:** [Curious]  
So I want to hear your story! How did you end up with Sarah?

**COOPER:** [Happy memory]  
Well, Sarah had always wanted a Golden Retriever. She grew up with them!

**[VISUAL: Photo of Sarah with childhood dog]**

**COOPER:** [Continuing]  
She found me through a rescue organization here in Colorado. I was about 8 weeks old.

**TULSI:** [Interested]  
A rescue? Tell me more about that!

**COOPER:** [Thoughtful]  
Yeah! My first family couldn't keep all the puppies - there were eight of us! - so the rescue helped find us homes.

**(beat, warm)**

And then I met Sarah, and it was... I don't know, it just felt right, you know?

**[VISUAL: Photo of Cooper's adoption day]**

**TULSI:** [Touched]  
That's so sweet! Love at first sight!

**COOPER:** [Joking]  
Well, I did pee on her shoes during our first meeting...

**TULSI:** [Laughing]  
Classic puppy move!

**COOPER:** [Sheepish]  
She laughed and said, "Well, I guess that means he's comfortable!" 

And I've been comfortable ever since!

**[VISUAL: Montage of Cooper at home - playing, sleeping, being loved]**

**TULSI:** [Sincere]  
I love that! Rescue pets are the BEST!

**COOPER:** [Agreeing]  
We really are! We're just so grateful, you know?

### SHOPPING TOGETHER (2:40 - 4:15)

**[VISUAL: Tulsi and Cooper walking through store]**

**TULSI:** [Conversational]  
Okay, so what are we shopping for today?

**COOPER:** [Checking mental list]  
Well, I need more of my food - the salmon and sweet potato kind...

**[VISUAL: Walking to food section]**

**COOPER:**  
Some dental chews - gotta keep these teeth sparkling!

**TULSI:** [Approving]  
Dental health is important!

**[VISUAL: Dental treat section]**

**COOPER:**  
And... *[looks around conspiratorially]* ...maybe a new toy?

**TULSI:** [Excited]  
TOYS! My favorite department!

**[VISUAL: Walking to toy aisle]**

**TULSI:** [Curious]  
What kind of toys do you like, Cooper?

**COOPER:** [Thoughtful]  
I'm a fetch guy, mostly. Balls, frisbees, anything I can bring back!

**(beat, proud)**

I've got a REALLY good retrieve!

**[VISUAL: Cooper examining toys]**

**COOPER:**  
But I also like puzzle toys! The ones where you have to figure out how to get the treats out!

**TULSI:** [Impressed]  
Ooh, you like a challenge!

**COOPER:** [Modest]  
Keeps the mind sharp!

**[VISUAL: Cooper finding a toy he likes]**

**COOPER:** [Excited]  
Oh! OH! What about this one?

**[VISUAL: Tough rubber ball with rope]**

**TULSI:** [Examining it]  
Ooh, this is a good one! It's super durable - it says it's for "aggressive chewers"!

**COOPER:**  
I'm not *aggressive*, I'm just... enthusiastic!

**TULSI:** [Laughing]  
Fair point!

**(beat, helpful)**

And it has the rope, so it's easy for Sarah to throw it far!

**COOPER:** [Decided]  
Perfect! Let's get it!

**[VISUAL: Putting toy in basket]**

**TULSI:** [Friendly]  
While we're here, let me show you something cool that just came in...

**[VISUAL: New product display]**

**TULSI:**  
These are freeze-dried raw food toppers! You sprinkle them on your regular food for extra flavor and nutrition!

**COOPER:** [Interested]  
Really? What flavors?

**TULSI:**  
Beef, chicken, and lamb! They're single-ingredient, no additives.

**COOPER:** [Curious]  
Hmm... Sarah's been saying I'm kind of picky lately...

**TULSI:** [Encouraging]  
These might help! We have samples if you want to try!

**COOPER:** [Enthusiastic]  
Yes! I love samples!

**[VISUAL: Sample station, Cooper trying it]**

**COOPER:** [Reaction]  
*[Eating]*

Oh WOW! That's really good!

**TULSI:** [Happy]  
Right?! 

**COOPER:**  
Okay, we're definitely getting these!

### PERSONAL QUESTIONS (4:15 - 5:20)

**[VISUAL: Tulsi and Cooper sitting together in quieter area]**

**TULSI:** [Friendly]  
Okay, quick-fire questions! Ready?

**COOPER:** [Game]  
Ready!

**TULSI:**  
Favorite food?

**COOPER:**  
Besides everything? *[laughs]* Probably chicken! But like, actual chicken, not just chicken-flavored things.

**TULSI:**  
Favorite activity?

**COOPER:**  
Swimming! We go to the dog park with the pond, and I could swim for HOURS!

**TULSI:**  
Ooh, I'm not a huge swimmer myself!

**COOPER:**  
Really? You're missing out!

**TULSI:** [Playful]  
Maybe you can teach me someday!

**(beat)**

Okay, favorite spot in your house?

**COOPER:** [Thinking]  
Hmm... There's this spot on the couch where the sun comes through the window in the afternoon...

**(pause, blissful)**

That's peak nap territory!

**TULSI:** [Relating]  
Sunbeam naps are the BEST!

**COOPER:**  
Right?!

**TULSI:**  
Okay, last question - what's the best part about being a dog?

**COOPER:** [Thoughtful, sincere]  
Honestly? The people.

**(pause)**

Like, humans are just... they're so happy to see you! Every single time!

**(beat, warm)**

Sarah comes home from work, and I'm excited, but she's like JUST as excited to see me! Every day!

**(pause, emotional)**

That's pretty special, you know?

**TULSI:** [Touched]  
Cooper, that's beautiful!

**COOPER:**  
Plus, belly rubs. Belly rubs are a close second.

**TULSI:** [Laughing]  
There it is!

### CHECKOUT & GOODBYE (5:20 - 6:15)

**[VISUAL: At checkout counter]**

**TULSI:** [Friendly]  
Alright, let's see what we got!

**[VISUAL: Items on counter]**

**TULSI:**  
Food, dental chews, new ball, and food toppers! Great choices!

**COOPER:**  
Thanks! I can't wait to try that ball!

**[VISUAL: Packing up]**

**TULSI:** [Sincere]  
Cooper, thank you so much for hanging out with me today!

**COOPER:**  
Are you kidding? This was so fun!

**TULSI:**  
You want to tell everyone where they can find you?

**COOPER:** [To camera]  
Um, well, I'm not on social media myself...

**(beat, joking)**

...I don't have opposable thumbs, so typing is hard...

**TULSI:** [Laughing]  
Fair point!

**COOPER:**  
But Sarah posts pictures of me sometimes! And we're usually at Barnum Dog Park on weekends if anyone wants to say hi!

**TULSI:**  
That's the one on the west side, right?

**COOPER:**  
Yep! Big grassy area, pond for swimming, it's great!

**[VISUAL: Tulsi and Cooper at front door]**

**TULSI:**  
Alright friend, see you soon!

**COOPER:**  
See you, Tulsi! Thanks again!

**[VISUAL: Goodbye nose boop or high five]**

### CLOSING (6:15 - 6:45)

**[VISUAL: Tulsi watching Cooper leave]**

**TULSI:** [Warm, reflective]  
You know, this is why I love this job.

**(pause)**

It's not just about selling products - it's about being part of a community!

**[VISUAL: Montage of other regular customers and pets]**

**TULSI:**  
We get to know our customers, hear their stories, watch their pets grow up...

**(beat, sincere)**

It's really special!

**[VISUAL: Back to Tulsi]**

**TULSI:** [To camera]  
If you have a pet and a cool story, I'd love to feature you! Just ask next time you visit!

**(pause, excited)**

Next week, I'm taking you behind the scenes to show you how we stock the shelves and organize everything! It's way more interesting than it sounds, I promise!

**TULSI:** [Sign-off]  
Thanks for coming on this adventure, friends!

Keep those tails wagging!

See you next time! 🐾
