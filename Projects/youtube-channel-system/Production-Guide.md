- Voice generation: 15-30 minutes
- Editing: 3-5 hours

---

## PHASE 1: PRE-PRODUCTION (Before Filming)

### Step 1.1: Choose Episode Template

Review the 10 episode templates and select one:
1. Day in the Life
2. Product Review
3. Customer Pet Feature
4. Behind the Scenes
5. Educational Tips
6. Challenge Episode
7. Busy Day
8. Story Time
9. Customer Testimonial
10. Community Event

**Decision factors:**
- What's happening this week at the store?
- Any new products to feature?
- Interesting customers/pets available?
- Seasonal relevance?

### Step 1.2: Plan the Shoot

**Create shot list:**
- [ ] Intro location (where Tulsi will "talk" to camera)
- [ ] B-roll needed (products, customers, activities)
- [ ] Key moments to capture
- [ ] Any special guests/participants
- [ ] Props needed (toys, treats, products to feature)

**Timing:**
- Best filming times: Tuesday-Thursday (moderate traffic) or Saturday (busy, lots of activity)
- Duration: Plan for 30-60 minutes of filming for 5-7 minute final video
- Multiple angles: Film the same scene from 2-3 angles when possible

**Permissions:**
- Customer release forms ready
- Permission for employee features
- Sign in pet store window: "Filming in progress for YouTube"

### Step 1.3: Equipment Check

**Minimum Required:**
- Smartphone with good camera (iPhone 11+ or equivalent Android)
- Tripod or stable surface
- Good lighting (natural window light or cheap LED panel)
- Quiet environment for clear audio (store before opening or during slow periods)

**Recommended Additions:**
- External microphone for phone (Rode VideoMic Me - $60)
- Ring light or LED panel ($30-80)
- Gimbal stabilizer for walking shots (optional, $100-200)

---

## PHASE 2: FILMING

### Step 2.1: Setting Up Shots

**Basic Composition Rules:**
- **Rule of Thirds:** Place Tulsi slightly off-center
- **Eye Level:** Camera at Tulsi's eye level for most shots
- **Headroom:** Small space above Tulsi's head, not too much
- **Clean Background:** Avoid clutter, use store displays strategically

**Lighting Tips:**
- Natural light from windows is best (diffused, not direct sunlight)
- Avoid overhead fluorescent lights (creates harsh shadows)
- Light should be in front of subject, not behind (no silhouettes)
- Consistent lighting throughout shoot (same time of day)

### Step 2.2: Shot Types to Capture

**Essential Shots (Get these every time):**

1. **A-Roll (Tulsi "talking" shots):**
   - 3-5 different locations around store
   - 10-15 seconds each
   - Tulsi looking at camera, natural expressions
   - Multiple takes (you'll choose best in editing)

2. **B-Roll (Supporting footage):**
   - Wide shots: Entire store, different aisles
   - Medium shots: Customers browsing, employees working
   - Close-ups: Products, treats, toys, Tulsi's reactions
   - Action shots: Tulsi playing, walking, interacting
   - Detail shots: Ingredient labels, price tags, textures

3. **Transition Shots:**
   - Doors opening/closing
   - Tulsi walking through frame
   - Products changing
   - Time passing (clock, lighting changes)

**Pro Tips:**
- **5-second rule:** Hold every shot for at least 5 seconds (easier to edit)
- **Get doubles:** Film important moments from 2 angles
- **Sound:** Get 30 seconds of "room tone" (silence with store ambiance)
- **Variety:** Mix wide, medium, and close shots

### Step 2.3: Filming Checklist

Before you stop filming, verify you have:
- [ ] At least 5 Tulsi "talking" positions
- [ ] 20+ B-roll clips (various subjects)
- [ ] Any special moments (customer interactions, product tests)
- [ ] Clean audio (check for background noise)
- [ ] Enough lighting consistency
- [ ] Release forms signed (if featuring customers/pets)

## PHASE 5: VIDEO EDITING

### Step 5.1: Software Setup

**Recommended Free Options:**
- **CapCut** (easiest, great for beginners)
- **DaVinci Resolve** (more powerful, steeper learning curve)
- **iMovie** (Mac users, simple)

**Paid Options:**
- Adobe Premiere Pro ($20/month - professional)
- Final Cut Pro ($300 one-time - Mac only)

**We'll use CapCut for this guide (works on desktop & mobile):**

### Step 5.2: Import & Organize

**Project Setup:**
1. Create new project: "Tulsi Episode [#]"
2. Set aspect ratio: 16:9 (YouTube standard)
3. Frame rate: 30fps or 60fps (match your footage)
4. Import files:
   - All video clips
   - Tulsi voiceover (MP3)
   - Background music
   - Intro/outro graphics
   - Sound effects

**Organize Timeline:**
- **Track 1:** Main video footage
- **Track 2:** Tulsi voiceover
- **Track 3:** Background music
- **Track 4:** Sound effects
- **Track 5:** Graphics/text overlays

### Step 5.3: Rough Cut Assembly

**Step-by-step:**

1. **Drag voiceover to Track 2 first** (this is your guide!)

2. **Add intro sequence (0:00-0:05):**
   - Animated intro template
   - "Tulsi's Pet Store Adventures" title
   - Upbeat music sting

3. **Match video to voiceover:**
   - Listen to a section of voiceover
   - Find matching B-roll that illustrates what Tulsi is saying
   - Drag video clip to Track 1, sync with voiceover
   - Trim to fit
   - Repeat for entire script

4. **Use Tulsi "talking" shots strategically:**
   - Every 20-30 seconds, cut to Tulsi looking at camera
   - Creates connection with audience
   - Varies visuals
   - Don't overuse (60% B-roll, 40% Tulsi shots)

5. **Add outro (last 10 seconds):**
   - Outro template
   - Subscribe button animation
   - Next episode tease
   - Social media handles

### Step 5.4: Fine-Tuning Edit

**Pacing:**
- Cut on action when possible
- Vary shot lengths: 2-5 seconds average
- Faster cuts for exciting moments
- Longer shots for emotional/reflective moments
- No shot shorter than 1 second (too jarring)

**Transitions:**
- Use simple cuts for 90% of transitions
- Occasional cross-dissolve for time passing
- Avoid flashy transitions (too distracting)

**Visual Interest:**
- Add slight zoom/pan to static shots (Ken Burns effect)
- Use slow motion sparingly (emotional moments)
- Crop/reframe shots if needed

### Step 5.5: Add Music & Sound

**Background Music:**
- Source: YouTube Audio Library, Epidemic Sound, Artlist
- Genre: Upbeat acoustic, light pop, instrumental
- Volume: -20dB to -25dB (quiet, not overpowering)
- Fade in/out at beginning and end
- Duck volume when Tulsi talks (automatic in most editors)

**Sound Effects:**
- Squeaky toy sounds (enhance product testing)
- Door bells (transitions)
- "Boop" or "ding" (text appearing)
- Cash register (purchases)
- Gentle whoosh (scene changes)

**Volume Levels:**
- Voiceover: -3dB to 0dB (loudest element)
- Music: -20dB to -25dB
- Sound effects: -10dB to -15dB
- Adjust for clarity - voiceover must always be clear

### Step 5.6: Graphics & Text

**Text Overlays (use sparingly):**
- Episode title card (0:05)
- Customer/pet names when introduced
- Key tips ("Remember: Check ingredients!")
- Product names/prices
- Location tags
- Social media handles (subtle, lower third)

**Design Guidelines:**
- Font: Clean, sans-serif (e.g., Montserrat, Poppins)
- Colors: Warm orange (#FF8C42), sky blue (#6BB6FF), white
- Size: Large enough to read on mobile
- Duration: On screen long enough to read 2x
- Animation: Simple slide or fade in/out

**Graphics to Add:**
- Paw print transitions
- Rating graphics (paw ratings for product reviews)
- Comparison charts
- Before/after graphics
- Episode number bug (small, corner of screen)

### Step 5.7: Color Grading

**Basic Color Correction:**
1. Adjust exposure (brightness)
2. Increase saturation slightly (+10-15%)
3. Warm up color temperature
4. Increase contrast slightly
5. Ensure Tulsi stands out visually

**CapCut Preset:** Use "Warm" or "Cozy" filter at 30-50% strength

**Goal:** Consistent, inviting, warm aesthetic

### Step 5.8: Captions/Subtitles

**Why they matter:**
- 85% of videos watched without sound
- Accessibility for hearing impaired
- Better engagement/retention
- SEO benefits

**How to add:**
1. Auto-generate in CapCut (Speech to Text)
2. Review and fix errors
3. Style: White text, black outline, bottom center
4. Font: Large, clean, easy to read
5. Also export as .SRT file for YouTube upload

### Step 5.9: Final Review Checklist

## TROUBLESHOOTING

### Common Issues & Solutions

**Problem:** Footage is shaky
**Solution:** Use phone tripod, stabilize in editing (CapCut has stabilization)

**Problem:** Audio has echo/background noise
**Solution:** Film during quiet times, add light music to mask, use noise reduction

**Problem:** Video feels slow/boring
**Solution:** Cut 20% of content, faster cuts, stronger opening hook

**Problem:** Colors look flat
**Solution:** Increase saturation +15%, adjust contrast, use warm color grade

**Problem:** Text is hard to read
**Solution:** Larger font, thicker outline, simpler background

**Problem:** Music is too loud
**Solution:** Lower to -20dB, use auto-duck feature when voiceover plays

**Problem:** Voiceover sounds robotic
**Solution:** Regenerate with different settings, add more punctuation to script for natural pausing

**Problem:** Video too long (>10 min)
**Solution:** Cut tangents, tighten pacing, split into 2 episodes

---

## FINAL TIPS

1. **Consistency matters more than perfection** - publish regularly even if not perfect
2. **Improve incrementally** - each video should be slightly better than the last
3. **Batch similar tasks** - film multiple episodes same day, edit multiple same day
4. **Create templates** - save time with repeatable intro/outro, thumbnail templates
5. **Ask for feedback** - friends, family, early subscribers
6. **Study successful channels** - what do they do well?
7. **Enjoy the process** - your enthusiasm shows in the final product
