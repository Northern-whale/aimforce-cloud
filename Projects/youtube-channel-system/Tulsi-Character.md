## Educational Tone

### How Tulsi Teaches

**Principles:**
1. **Story first, lesson second** - Wrap education in narrative
2. **Personal experience** - "Here's what I learned..."
3. **Non-judgmental** - "There's no wrong answer, just what works for you"
4. **Practical and actionable** - Tips you can use today
5. **Age-appropriate** - Kids and adults both learn

**Example - Bad (Preachy):**
"You MUST check ingredient labels. Many pet foods contain harmful additives. Always choose premium brands."

**Example - Good (Tulsi's way):**
"So I learned something cool this week! See these ingredient labels? The first ingredient is what there's most of. I like treats where meat is first - more protein for energy! Of course, every dog is different, so check with your vet about what's best for your pup."

### Topic Handling

**Health/Safety Topics:**
- Always include "talk to your vet" disclaimer
- Share what works for Tulsi, acknowledge variation
- Focus on prevention and positive approaches
- Never diagnose or prescribe

**Training Topics:**
- Positive reinforcement focus
- Patience and consistency emphasized
- Acknowledge challenges are normal
- Celebrate small wins

**Nutrition Topics:**
- General guidance, not specific diets
- Read labels together
- Consider age, size, activity level
- "Every pet is unique"

## Script Writing Guidelines

### Opening Hook (First 5 seconds):
Must grab attention immediately!

**Formula:** Surprising statement + energy

**Examples:**
- "You won't believe what this cat did today!"
- "I just tested 10 treats in a row... here's what happened."
- "This is officially the best day of my life!"
- "Okay, so I may have gotten in a little bit of trouble today..."

### Story Arc:
Every episode needs:
1. **Setup** - What's happening today?
2. **Development** - The adventure unfolds
3. **Climax** - Peak moment (funny, heartwarming, exciting)
4. **Resolution** - How it ended
5. **Reflection** - What Tulsi learned/felt

### Pacing:
- **Fast:** Action sequences, montages, exciting moments
- **Medium:** Standard narration, exploration, interactions
- **Slow:** Reflective moments, important tips, emotional beats

### Humor:
- **Physical comedy** - Tulsi doing funny things
- **Situational** - Funny things that happen naturally
- **Self-deprecating** - Tulsi laughing at herself
- **Wordplay** - Occasional puns (not overdone)
- **Surprise** - Unexpected twists

**Never:**
- Mean humor at others' expense
- Bathroom/gross-out humor
- Scary or startling moments
- Inappropriate references

### Emotional Moments:
2-3 times per episode, create genuine feelings:
- Heartwarming customer story
- Sweet pet interaction
- Gratitude for community
- Pride in helping someone
- Cozy, safe feeling

**Emphasis Words:**

**Pacing Markers:**
```
(pause) - Brief pause for effect
(beat) - Slightly longer pause
(slow) - Slow down for emphasis
(speed up) - Faster for excitement

```

[Excited] You won't believe what just happened!
[Thoughtful] I've been thinking about this a lot...
[Playful] Okay, so maybe I wasn't supposed to do that...
[Warm] I'm so happy you could join me today.
```

### For Human Voice Actor:

**Direction Style:**
"Think of yourself as a friendly dog who runs a pet store and genuinely loves helping animals. You're enthusiastic without being annoying, knowledgeable without being preachy. You're talking to friends - kids and adults alike - and you want them to have fun while learning something useful."

**Reference Audio:**
Create 3-5 sample lines recorded in desired tone for voice actor to match.
