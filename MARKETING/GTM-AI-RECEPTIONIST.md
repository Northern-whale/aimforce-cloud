---

## 1. Positioning Statement

### Who It's For
Small to medium businesses (1-50 employees) with high call volume who are:
- Missing calls due to staff shortages
- Losing sales opportunities to voicemail
- Lacking visibility into customer interests and demand patterns
- Spending $500-2000/month on receptionist staff

**Primary Verticals:**
1. **Specialty Retail** (cigar shops, wine stores, boutiques) - 30% initial focus
2. **Restaurants & Hospitality** (reservations, takeout) - 25%
3. **Professional Services** (law, dental, medical practices) - 25%
4. **Home Services** (HVAC, plumbing, contractors) - 20%

### What Problem It Solves

**Primary Pain Points:**
- **Missed Revenue:** 30-40% of calls to small businesses go to voicemail during busy hours
- **Labor Costs:** Part-time receptionist = $15-25/hour × 20-30 hours = $1,200-3,000/month
- **Zero Intelligence:** Traditional answering services just take messages—no insights

Subject: [Business Name] - I noticed you're missing calls

Hi [Owner Name],

I saw [specific review mentioning voicemail/hard to reach].

We built an AI receptionist specifically for [industry] businesses 
that handles calls 24/7 AND tracks which products customers ask 
about most.

[Cigar Shop in City] uses it to never miss calls during busy hours 
and discovered their customers mention "Cohiba" 3x more than they 
thought—so they adjusted inventory.

Want to see it handle a real call to your business?

I can call your number, show you how the AI responds, and you'll 
see the dashboard update in real-time. Takes 5 minutes.

[Calendar link] or just reply.

[Your Name]
[Title]

P.S. No setup required for the demo—you just watch.
```

4. If engaged: "Built something that might help—can I show you?"

### Demo Script (Technical Demo Exists - This is Sales Demo)

**Pre-Demo (2 minutes):**
"Thanks for joining. Quick question before we start: What happens right now when someone calls during your busiest hours?"

[Listen, empathize]

"Got it. So here's what we're going to do in the next 10 minutes:
1. I'll call your business number while you watch
2. You'll see the AI handle it naturally
3. We'll look at the dashboard and what intelligence you'd get
4. You decide if it's worth $149/month to never miss calls again.

Sound good?"

**Demo Flow (8 minutes):**

**Part 1: The Call (3 min)**
- Share screen showing dashboard
- Use phone to call prospect's actual number
- If they don't have AI yet: "Imagine your AI picks up instead of voicemail"
- Walk through what customer hears
- Show greeting, navigation, information gathering

**Part 2: The Intelligence (3 min)**
- Dashboard: "Here's what just happened"
- Call log appears
- Transcript shows up
- Products mentioned are highlighted
- "Now imagine 20 calls today. You'd see patterns:
  - Which products customers ask about most
  - What questions come up repeatedly
  - When call volume spikes"

**Part 3: The Business Value (2 min)**
- "Let's say you get 30 calls a day, 10 would normally go to voicemail"
- "If 20% of those convert at $150 average sale..."
- "That's $900/month you're missing"
- "Plus you save $1,500 on reception staff"
- "Total value: $2,400/month. Cost: $249."

**Close:**
"Two paths forward:
1. Start with 7-day trial—I'll set it up today, you test with real calls
2. Or if you want to think about it, I can send you the cigar shop case study

Which feels right?"

[Carousel with statistics]"

Day 3: **Case Study**
"[Cigar Shop Owner] thought he knew what his customers wanted. Then he saw the data.

His AI receptionist revealed customers were asking about premium cigars 3x more than expected.

He adjusted inventory. Sales up 23% in 60 days.

The best part? Setup took 15 minutes.

Link in comments to see how."

Day 5: **Poll**
"Quick poll for small business owners:

What happens to calls when you're busy with customers?

🔵 Voicemail
🟢 Employee answers
🟡 Answering service
🟣 Just rings

(We built something for the 🔵 voters)"

Day 7: **Video Post**
"Watch an AI receptionist handle a real call to a cigar shop.

Notice how it:
✅ Answers naturally
✅ Tracks product mentions
✅ Captures customer intent

This is running 24/7 for $249/month.

Day 9: **Pain Point Post**
"You know that sinking feeling when you check voicemail and hear:

'Hi, I was calling to place an order but I'll just try somewhere else.'

That's $200 that walked away because you were busy.

It happens 10-15 times a month for most small businesses.

That's $2,000-3,000 in lost revenue.

Every. Single. Month.

There's a better way. [Link]"

Part-time receptionist:
• 20 hours/week
• $18/hour
• = $1,548/month

AI receptionist:
• 24/7 coverage
• Business intelligence included
• = $249/month

That's $1,299/month saved.

Day 2: **Technical Thread**
"How we built an AI receptionist that actually understands context 🧵

1/ Started with ElevenLabs for voice (most natural sounding)
2/ Custom NLP for product mention tracking
3/ Real-time dashboard with Next.js
4/ Webhook architecture = 15min setup

Thread below 👇"

Day 4: **Engagement**
"Hot take: Most AI call tools solve the wrong problem.

Handling calls is easy.
Generating intelligence is hard.

Small businesses don't need another answering service.
They need to know what customers ACTUALLY want.

That's what we built."

Day 6: **Screenshot**
"This dashboard shows a cigar shop owner that customers mentioned 'Cohiba' 47 times this week.

He had 12 in stock. Sold out in 2 days.

Ordered 30 more.

This is what AI should do: surface opportunities hiding in plain sight.

[Dashboard screenshot]"

Day 8: **Meme**

Top (disapproval): Expensive answering service that just takes messages
Bottom (approval): AI that answers calls AND tells you what customers want

Day 10: **Founder Story**
"Why we built this:

My friend owns a cigar shop. Works alone most days.

When he's helping a customer, calls go to voicemail.

Each missed call = potential $100-500 sale lost.

I asked: 'What if AI could handle calls AND tell you what people are asking for?'

Built a demo in 2 weeks.
He's using it today.
Never misses calls.

Now we're launching it for everyone."

Day 12: **Tactical Tweet**
"Small business growth hack nobody talks about:

Track which products customers mention on calls.

You'll discover:
- What to stock more of
- What nobody cares about
- Emerging trends
- Competitive threats

Our AI does this automatically for every call.

Game changer."

Day 14: **Offer**
"If you run a small business and miss calls regularly, I'll personally set up our AI receptionist for you.

Free demo. Free setup. No commitment.

Just want to show you what's possible.

DM me."

(That's the #1 pain point we solve - happy to show you how.)

[Your Name]

**Email 3: Day 7 (Value-focused)**
Subject: How [Similar Business] captures every call

Hi [Name],

Thought you might find this interesting:

[Business Name] in [City] was missing 15-20 calls per day.

After implementing our AI receptionist:
✅ Zero missed calls (24/7 coverage)
✅ Discovered customers were asking about [Product X] constantly
✅ Adjusted inventory, saw 23% sales increase

Setup took 15 minutes.

Full case study: [Link]

Worth exploring?

[Your Name]

**Email 4: Day 14 (Last touch - ROI focused)**
Subject: The math on this is pretty simple

Hi [Name],

I'll make this quick.

If you're missing even 5 calls per week to voicemail:

- If 15% would convert
- At $100 average transaction

That's $300/month walking away.

Our Business plan: $249/month
Captures those calls + gives you intelligence

ROI: Positive from day 1.
