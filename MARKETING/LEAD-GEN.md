## Overview

This playbook covers lead generation for:
1. **AI Receptionist** (SMB focus)
2. **Polymarket Tools** (trader focus)
3. **Agency Services** (entrepreneur/business focus)

Each product has different audiences, channels, and tactics. This guide provides the complete toolkit.

---

## 1. Automated Outreach

### AI Receptionist: SMB Cold Outreach

#### Target Profile
- **Industry:** Restaurants, retail, professional services, home services
- **Size:** 1-20 employees
- **Indicators:** Reviews mention "hard to reach", "went to voicemail", "never answers"
- **Location:** US, Canada, UK, Australia
- **Decision maker:** Owner or manager

#### Finding Targets (Tools & Methods)

**Google Maps + Reviews Mining:**
```
Process:
1. Search Google Maps: "[Industry] near [City]"
2. Filter: 3-20 reviews (established but not huge)
3. Read reviews for pain indicators:
   - "Couldn't reach them"
   - "Went straight to voicemail"
   - "Hard to get ahold of"
4. Export: Business name, phone, website, owner (if listed)
```

**Yelp Scraping:**
- Similar process to Google Maps
- Filter by "$$" or "$$$" (price range)
- Look for businesses with good reviews but communication complaints

**LinkedIn Search:**
- Find: "Owner at [Cigar Shop/Restaurant/etc.]"
- Location: United States
- Company size: 1-50 employees
- Export contact info

**Tools:**
- **PhantomBuster** ($60/mo) - Automate scraping
- **Apollo.io** ($49/mo) - B2B contact database
- **Hunter.io** ($49/mo) - Find email addresses
- **Instantly.ai** ($37/mo) - Cold email automation

#### Email Templates

**Template 1: Review-Based Outreach**
```
Subject: [Business Name] - saw your Yelp review

Hi [Owner Name],

I noticed a review on [Yelp/Google] mentioned they had 
trouble reaching you by phone.

Totally get it—when you're helping customers in person, 
calls go to voicemail. That's why we built [Product].

It's an AI receptionist that:
✓ Answers 24/7 (never misses calls)
✓ Tracks what customers ask about (so you know what to stock)
✓ Works alongside you (not replacing anyone)

[Similar Business] in [City] uses it to capture 15+ calls 
per day they used to miss.

Would a 5-minute demo make sense? I can show you live.

[Calendar link] or just reply with your availability.

Best,
[Name]

P.S. Setup is 15 minutes, and you can try it free for 7 days.
```

**Response Rate Goal:** 5-10%  
**Demo Booking Rate:** 20-30% of responses  
**Volume:** 50 emails/week = 2-5 responses = 1-2 demos

---

**Template 2: Industry-Specific Value**
```
Subject: For cigar shop owners - never miss calls again

Hi [Name],

Quick question: How many calls do you miss when you're 
helping customers in the humidor?

We built an AI receptionist specifically for retail businesses 
like yours.

It doesn't just answer calls—it tracks which products 
customers ask about most.

[Cigar Shop in City] discovered customers were asking about 
Cohiba 3x more than they thought. Adjusted inventory, sales 
up 23%.

Want to see it handle a call? I can call your shop live 
while you watch the dashboard.

Takes 5 minutes: [Calendar link]

Cheers,
[Name]

P.S. Currently $149/mo vs. $1,500+ for part-time staff.
```

---

**Template 3: Direct ROI Focus**
```
Subject: Missing calls = missing revenue

Hi [Name],

Saw [Business] on Google. 4.5 stars—nice!

Quick math:
- If you get 30 calls/day
- And 30% go to voicemail (industry avg)
- That's ~9 missed calls per day

If just 2 of those would've bought something...
At $100 average transaction...
You're missing $6,000/month.

Our AI receptionist costs $249/mo and catches every call.

ROI: 24x

#### Follow-Up Sequence

**Day 1:** Initial email  
**Day 3:** Follow-up if no response
```
Subject: Re: [Original subject]

Hi [Name],

Did you get a chance to see my email about the AI receptionist?

I'm genuinely curious: What happens to calls when you're 
busy with customers right now?

(That's the exact problem we solve.)

[Name]
```

**Day 7:** Case study approach
```
Subject: How [Similar Business] captures every call

[Name],

Thought you might find this interesting:

[Business Name] was missing 10-15 calls per day.

After setting up our AI receptionist:
→ Zero missed calls
→ Tracked customer interests
→ Discovered hidden demand for products

Full breakdown: [Link to case study]

Worth 5 minutes to see if it fits your business?

[Name]
```

**Day 14:** Final email
```
Subject: Last email (promise)

Hi [Name],

I'll keep this short—this is my last email.

If you ever want to:
- Stop missing calls
- Know what customers actually want
- Save $1,500/mo on reception costs

We're here: [website]

Take care,
[Name]
```

or using tools?

We built a scanner that monitors all markets + backtests 
strategies. Beta launching next month.

Hey [Name],

Loved your post about [topic]. You mentioned [pain point]—
we actually specialize in exactly that.

Tars Labs builds AI products for entrepreneurs who know

Recent project: AI receptionist for small businesses 
(voice AI + analytics dashboard). Went from idea → 
paying customers in 8 weeks.

If you ever want to chat about AI product ideas, I'd be 
happy to share what we've learned.

No pressure—just here if useful.

Best,
[Name]

"We analyzed 10,000 calls to small businesses.

38% went to voicemail.

Each missed call = avg $87 lost revenue.

That's $10,800/month for a typical business.

AI doesn't need to be perfect. It just needs to answer."
```

**Tuesday:** Product Update
```
"Shipped: Product mention tracking for AI Receptionist.

Now you can see which items customers ask about most.

One shop discovered customers wanted a product they 
didn't even stock. Ordered it, sold out in 3 days.

That's the power of call intelligence."
```

**Wednesday:** Educational Thread
```
"How to know if your business needs an AI receptionist 
(thread) 🧵

1/ You miss >5 calls per day
2/ Staff complains about phone interruptions
3/ You lose sales to voicemail
4/ Customers say you're "hard to reach"
5/ You spend $1K+ on reception

Sound familiar? Here's what to do..."
```

**Thursday:** Behind-the-Scenes
```
"Debugging why the AI keeps saying 'um' between sentences.

Turns out: we were including filler tokens in the response.

One line of code fixed it.

3 hours to find the bug.
3 seconds to fix it.

Building AI is 90% detective work."
```

What's your biggest frustration with phone calls?

(Genuinely curious—helps us build better tools.)"
```

**Weekend:** Casual/Personal
```

12 went straight to voicemail.

ahead of 85% of competitors."
```

**Posting Cadence:** 1-3 tweets/day

#### LinkedIn Strategy

Our AI does the same job for $249/mo.

The real cost isn't the technology—it's inaction."
```

**Wednesday:** Case study
```
"Case Study: AI Receptionist ROI

Client: Local cigar shop
Problem: Missing 15 calls/day

Post: "How do I handle phone calls when I'm busy?"

Your comment:
"A few options:

1. Google Voice + auto-response (free, basic)
2. Virtual assistant (Fancy Hands, $30-50/mo, hit or miss)
3. Traditional answering service ($1-2/min, adds up fast)

AI is most cost-effective.

```

**2. Data/Insights Posts**
```
Title: "I analyzed 10,000 calls to small businesses - here's what I learned"

Post:
"Been building an AI receptionist, which means we've 
processed a LOT of call data. Thought I'd share some 
surprising findings:

- 38% of calls go to voicemail (during business hours!)
- Average call length: 4.2 minutes
- #1 reason customers call: Hours/location (even though it's on Google)
- Avg revenue per captured call: $87
- Customers mention 2-3 products per call on average

Biggest takeaway: Most businesses have NO IDEA what 
customers are actually calling about. They just know 
they're busy.

Anyone else seeing similar patterns?"
```

**3. AMAs (Ask Me Anything)**
```
Title: "I built an AI receptionist for small businesses - AMA"

Post:
"Over the past 6 months, I've been building an AI system 
that handles phone calls for small businesses and provides 
intelligence on what customers want.

Learned a ton about voice AI, small business operations, 
and what actually matters vs. what's just hype.

Happy to answer questions about:
- Building AI products

- What small businesses actually need
- Technical challenges we faced

Hi [Name],

I run Tars Labs—we build AI products for businesses.

I noticed you work with [industry] clients and thought 
there might be a partnership opportunity.

Many agencies want to offer AI services but don't have 
the technical team. That's where we come in:

- We build the AI products
- You sell to your clients (under your brand if you want)
- We split revenue (or referral fee)

Example: AI receptionist for restaurants. Your client 
pays $299/mo, you keep $150, we handle all tech.
