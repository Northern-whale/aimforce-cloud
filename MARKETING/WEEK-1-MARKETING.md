## Monday: Landing Page Copy + Structure

**Theme:** Content Foundation Day  
**Time Required:** 6-8 hours

### Tasks

#### Task 1: Landing Page Copywriting (3 hours)

**Page Sections to Write:**

**1. Hero Section**
```
Headline: Never Miss Another Call. Never Miss Another Insight.

Subheadline: AI receptionist for small businesses that answers 24/7 
and tells you what customers actually want.

CTA Button: "See Live Demo" (links to demo video or booking)
```

**2. Problem Section**
```
Headline: Missing Calls Is Missing Revenue

Copy:
"40% of calls to small businesses go to voicemail during busy hours.

Each missed call = potential customer walking away.

For the average business, that's $6,000+ lost every month.

You don't have a phone problem. You have a revenue leak."

[Visual: Phone ringing + voicemail icon + money flying away]
```

**3. Solution Section**
```
Headline: Meet Your New AI Receptionist

Copy:
"Our AI answers every call professionally, 24/7. But here's what makes 
it different: it doesn't just handle calls—it gives you intelligence.

✓ Never miss a call (even during rush hours)
✓ Track what customers ask about most
✓ Discover hidden demand for products/services
✓ Get daily insights delivered to your inbox

Think: Receptionist + market research team. For $149/month."

[Visual: Dashboard screenshot showing call log + product mentions]
```

**4. How It Works**
```
Headline: 15 Minutes to Launch

Step 1: Connect Your Phone (2 minutes)
→ Forward calls or use our number

Step 2: Customize Greeting (3 minutes)
→ Record or type what you want AI to say

Step 3: Add Products to Track (5 minutes)
→ List items you sell, we'll track mentions

Step 4: Go Live (5 minutes)
→ Test call, confirm it works, you're done

No complex setup. No IT required. No credit card to try.

[Visual: 4-step diagram with icons]
```

**5. Intelligence Feature (Unique Differentiator)**
```
Headline: Not Just Call Handling—Business Intelligence

Copy:
"Other services just answer calls. We tell you what's working.

Real example: Local shop discovered customers mentioned 'Cohiba cigars' 
3x more than expected. They adjusted inventory. Sales up 23%.

Your AI tracks:
→ Which products customers ask about most
→ Questions that come up repeatedly
→ When call volume spikes
→ What customers say about competitors

Make data-driven decisions. Every. Single. Day."

## Wednesday: Demo Video Production

**Theme:** Show, Don't Tell  
**Time Required:** 4-6 hours

### Tasks

#### Task 1: Write Demo Video Script (1 hour)

**Video Length:** 2-3 minutes  
**Format:** Screen recording + voiceover

**Script:**

```
[0:00-0:15] Hook
"What if your business never missed a call again? And what if 
every call gave you intelligence about what customers want?

Let me show you how it works."

[0:15-0:45] The Problem
"Here's the reality for most small businesses:

[Show: Phone ringing graphic]

Calls come in during busy hours. You're helping a customer. 
The call goes to voicemail.

That's a potential sale. Gone.

It happens 10-15 times a day for the average business.

That's $5,000-10,000 per month in lost revenue."

[0:45-1:30] The Solution (Live Demo)
"Watch this.

[Screen recording: Dashboard visible]

I'm calling a local cigar shop that uses our AI receptionist.

[Actually call the business]

[Show: AI answering, conversation happening]

Notice:
- Natural voice (sounds human)
- Answers questions accurately
- Professional tone

[Show: Dashboard updating in real-time]

Now here's the magic:

[Point to dashboard]

The AI just logged:
- Customer asked about 'Cohiba cigars'
- Mentioned price was a concern
- Called at 2:47pm

[Show: Product mentions chart]

Over time, you see patterns:
- Which products customers ask about most
- What questions come up repeatedly
- Peak call times

This is intelligence, not just call handling."

[1:30-2:00] ROI
"Let's talk ROI:

Part-time receptionist: $1,500-2,000/month
Our AI: $149-249/month

Plus you capture calls that would've gone to voicemail.

Even 5 extra sales per month = $500-1,000 recovered.

It pays for itself immediately."

[2:00-2:30] How to Start
"Getting started takes 15 minutes:

1. Connect your phone number
2. Customize the greeting
3. Test it with a call
4. Go live

No complex setup. No IT required.

Want to see it work for YOUR business?

Book a 5-minute demo: [Show calendar link on screen]

I'll call your actual business and you'll watch the AI + 
dashboard live.

Link in description.

Thanks for watching!"

## Thursday: Blog Content Blitz

**Time Required:** 6-8 hours

### Task 1: Write Blog Post #1 (2 hours)

**Title:** "The True Cost of Missed Calls: Why Voicemail Is Killing Small Business Revenue"

**Target Keyword:** "cost of missed calls"

**Outline:**

1. **Hook** - Start with shocking stat
   "38% of calls to small businesses go to voicemail. Here's what that costs you."

2. **The Hidden Revenue Leak**
   - Calculate: Calls/day × % to VM × conversion rate × avg sale
   - Example: 30 calls/day, 30% to VM = 9 missed, 20% would convert = $180/day lost

3. **Why It Happens**
   - Staff is busy with in-person customers
   - Can't hire fast enough during busy seasons
   - After-hours calls (nights, weekends)

4. **The Opportunity Cost**
   - Not just lost sales—also frustrated customers
   - They call competitors instead
   - Negative reviews ("could never reach them")

5. **Solutions Compared**
   - Hire more staff: $1,500-3,000/mo
   - Answering service: $500-2,000/mo, no intelligence
   - AI receptionist: $149-299/mo, includes insights

6. **ROI Calculator**
   - Link to calculator or embed simple version

7. **CTA**
   "See how AI can capture every call: [Demo link]"

   |---------|-------------|---------|-----|
   | Cost | $2K-4K/mo | $500-2K/mo | $149-299/mo |
   | Availability | Business hours | Varies | 24/7 |
   | Intelligence | Manual | Manual | Automatic |
   | Setup time | Weeks | Days | 15 min |
   | Scalability | Hire more | Add more | Instant |

3. **When to Choose Traditional**
   - Complex tasks requiring judgment
   - Important client relationships
   - Budget isn't a concern

4. **When to Choose Virtual**
   - Need human touch but not in-person
   - Flexible hours
   - Medium budget

5. **When to Choose AI**
   - High call volume
   - Need 24/7 coverage
   - Want business intelligence
   - Budget-conscious

6. **Hybrid Approach**

## Troubleshooting

**Problem: "I don't have a demo yet"**
→ Create mockup demo (screen record prototype)
→ Use competitor demo as reference (but clearly state "coming soon")

**Problem: "I can't code the landing page"**
→ Use Carrd ($19/year, super simple)
→ Or hire on Fiverr ($100-200, 48 hours)

**Problem: "I don't know what to write"**
→ Use AI (ChatGPT, Claude) to draft, then edit heavily
→ Copy structure from competitor blogs, make it better

**Problem: "No one is responding"**
→ Volume is low (10 emails isn't enough, send 50)
→ Message isn't compelling (test different subject lines)
→ List is bad (research better prospects)

**Week 1 is your foundation. Execute relentlessly. Ship daily. Momentum builds. 🚀**
