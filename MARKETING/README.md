## 🔥 Key Recommendations

### For AI Receptionist (Start Here):

1. **Positioning:** Focus on "business intelligence" (not just call handling)
   - Differentiate from Bland AI, Air AI (they don't offer insights)

2. **Pricing:** Start with Business tier at $249/mo
   - Starter ($149) is for trial/testing
   - Enterprise ($499) for scaling later

3. **Target Market:** Cigar shops, wine stores, specialty retail FIRST
   - You have a working demo (credibility)
   - Small market = easier to dominate
   - Expand to restaurants, professional services later

4. **Content Strategy:** SEO-focused blog posts
   - "Cost of missed calls"
   - "AI receptionist vs. alternatives"
   - Target 1,000+ search volume keywords

5. **Lead Gen:** Cold email 50 businesses/week
   - Use review-based outreach (find pain in their reviews)
   - Personalize every email
   - 5-10% response rate expected

---

### For Polymarket Tools (Phase 2):

1. **Positioning:** "Institutional-grade tools for serious traders"
   - Not for casual bettors
   - Target: $5K-50K deployed traders

2. **Distribution:** Twitter-first strategy (60% of effort)
   - Crypto traders live on Twitter
   - Share backtest data, insights, performance
   - Build in public

3. **Beta Launch:** 100 users, 50% off forever pricing
   - Creates urgency + loyal early adopters

---

### For Agency Brand:

1. **Name:** Tars Labs (recommended)
   - Register: tarslabs.com, tarslabs.ai

2. **Services:** Start with productized offerings
   - "AI Receptionist Setup: $5K"
   - "Automation Integration: $10K"
   - Don't do custom everything (scales poorly)

3. **Portfolio:** Lead with your own products
   - Credibility: "We built these, we can build yours"
