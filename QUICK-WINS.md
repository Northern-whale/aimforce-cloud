- ✅ Fully functional demo (can show today)
- ✅ Clear value proposition (save time, get insights)
- ✅ Defined target market (small businesses)
- ✅ Easy to explain (voice AI + dashboard)
- ✅ Recurring revenue (SaaS model)

**Polymarket:** Keep developing, but monetize later (higher complexity, compliance risks)

## 🚫 Common Mistakes to Avoid

**Don't:**
- ❌ Build more features before getting customers
- ❌ Spend weeks on perfect marketing materials

**Do:**
- ✅ Talk to 10 people this week
- ✅ Show the working demo
- ✅ Offer free trials
- ✅ Get feedback quickly
- ✅ Iterate based on real usage

---

## 🎓 Key Principles

**1. Speed Over Perfection**
- Week 1 goal: 1 paying customer (even at $0 trial converting)
- Learn from real users, not assumptions

**2. Personal Network First**
- 10x easier than cold outreach
- Higher trust = faster close
- Better feedback quality

**3. Service First, Scale Later**
- Manually onboard first 5 customers
- Learn what they really need
- Automate after you understand the process

**4. Prove Value Before Pricing**
- Free 30-day trial removes objections
- Let the product sell itself
- Conversion happens naturally when they see value

## 📞 Objection Handling

### "It's too expensive"
**Response:** "How much is your time worth? If this saves you 5 hours a month, you're already profitable. Plus, you get business insights worth way more than $149."

### "I need to think about it"
**Response:** "Totally understand. How about a free 30-day trial? Zero risk, and you'll know in a week if it works for you."

### "We don't get that many calls"
**Response:** "Even if you get 20 calls a week, that's tracking what customers want. The insights alone have helped businesses increase sales by 15%. Want to see the data?"

### "What if it doesn't understand our business?"
**Response:** "We customize the AI for your specific products and services. I'll personally train it and test it before it goes live. Plus, 30-day guarantee."
