## 🎯 REMEMBER

**You only need ONE yes to get started.**

**This meeting is practice even if they say no.**

**The worst outcome is learning what doesn't work.**

**The best outcome is $8,991 contract + your first client.**

## 💪 MINDSET MANTRAS

Before meeting, say these to yourself:

1. "I'm offering real value that solves a real problem."
2. "The price is fair and the ROI is clear."
3. "I know AI and marketing better than they do."
4. "If they say no, it's about fit - not about me."
5. "I've got this."
