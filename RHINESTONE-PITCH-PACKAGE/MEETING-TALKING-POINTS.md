# RHINESTONE PITCH - TALKING POINTS
**Quick Reference for Thursday Meeting**

---

## OPENING (2 minutes)

**Introduce yourself + Said:**
> "Thanks for meeting with us. I'm [Oybek], this is Said. We run an AI marketing agency that helps B2B companies build digital authority using AI-powered content systems. We specialize in recruiting and employer branding."

**Set agenda:**
> "We spent time researching Rhinestone and have a proposal for how we can help you build your digital presence in 90 days. This will take about 30 minutes, then we'll answer any questions. Sound good?"

---

## THE PROBLEM (5 minutes)

**Key Message:** You're selling employer branding without an employer brand.

**Say this:**
> "We did some research on Rhinestone before this meeting. Here's what we found: [Pull up their Google search on screen if possible]
> 
> - No company website
> - No LinkedIn company page
> - No social media presence
> - Basically zero digital footprint
> 
> Now, that's not criticism - it's an opportunity. But here's the challenge: You're selling employer branding services to companies, and the first thing prospects do is Google you. When they find nothing, that creates a credibility gap.
>
> Every sales conversation has a built-in objection: 'If you're so good at employer branding, why don't YOU have a brand?'"

**Pause. Let that land.**

**Then:**
> "We estimate this is costing you $100K-$250K per year in lost opportunities. Prospects who would hire you, but ghost after Googling. Deals you can't close because you can't show proof. And you're forced to compete on price instead of value."

---

## THE SOLUTION (3 minutes)

**Key Message:** Make Rhinestone your own best case study.

**Say this:**
> "Here's what we propose: Instead of fighting this credibility gap, lean into it. Use Rhinestone as your own case study.
>
> We build your complete digital presence in 90 days. Website, LinkedIn, consistent content, engagement, growth. We document everything - the before, the during, the after.
>
> At the end, you have:
> 1. A real digital presence that proves you know what you're doing
> 2. A case study showing measurable results
> 3. A methodology you can sell to YOUR clients
>
> Then every sales conversation changes. Instead of 'We're new but...' you say: 'We used our methodology on ourselves. Here's the proof. Here's the case study. Here's the framework we'll use for you.'"

**Pause.**

> "You go from commodity pricing ($1K-$3K/month) to premium pricing ($5K-$10K/month) because you have proof."

---

## WHAT WE'LL BUILD (5 minutes)

**Key Message:** Complete system in 90 days.

**Say this (use 4 fingers to count):**

> "Four phases:
>
> **1. Foundation (Weeks 1-2):** We build your website, set up LinkedIn company page, optimize the founder's profile, create your content strategy.
>
> **2. Content Engine (Weeks 3-4):** We configure AI systems to generate your posts automatically. You review and approve, we publish. Think of it as a ghostwriter + campaign manager in one.
>
> **3. Execution (Weeks 5-12):** We publish 3 posts per week on the founder's LinkedIn, 1 per week on company page. That's 36 posts total. Plus daily engagement to build community. You'll see growth every week.
>
> **4. Proof (Weeks 11-12):** We document everything in a professional case study. We package your methodology as 'The Rhinestone Method™' - something you can trademark and sell to your clients."

**Show them the EXECUTIVE-SUMMARY.md document.**

## SUCCESS METRICS (3 minutes)

**Key Message:** We track everything.

**Say this:**
> "Here's how we measure success over 90 days:
>
> **Growth:**
> - Your founder's LinkedIn: 500-1,000 new followers
> - Company page: 200-500 followers
> - Website live and discoverable on Google
>
> **Engagement:**
> - 36 posts published (zero missed weeks)
> - 50K-100K total impressions
> - 5-10% engagement rate - that's 2-3x industry average
>
> **Leads:**
> - 5-10 inbound inquiries from LinkedIn
> - 3-7 demo calls booked
> - And if we do our job right: 1-2 deals closed
>
> That last one is the ROI test. If you close even ONE client from this LinkedIn presence, you're profitable."

---

## ROI (3 minutes)

**Key Message:** Even conservative scenario = 4x return.

**Say this:**
> "Let's talk investment.
>
> **Cost:** $8,991 total (that's $2,997/month for 3 months)
>
> **Return:** If you close just 1 client at $3,000/month, that's $36,000 in annual revenue.
>
> Your return: 4x in the first year. Payback period: less than 60 days.
>
> If you close 2 clients - which is realistic based on the activity we'll generate - that's $90,000 in revenue. That's a 10x return.
>
> Plus you get the case study, the methodology, the content library - all worth another $10K-$20K if you were to buy them separately.
>
> Even in the worst case scenario, you're profitable."

---

## WHY US (2 minutes)

**Key Message:** AI-powered, industry-focused, aligned incentives.

**Say this:**
> "Why choose us?
>
> **1. Speed:** We use AI to generate content. What takes traditional agencies 10 hours, takes us 10 minutes. You get 10x more output for less cost.
>
> **2. Focus:** We specialize in recruiting and employer branding. We understand your market, your buyers, your industry.
>
> **3. Alignment:** We're documenting this as our case study too. Your success is literally our success. We're all-in on making this work."

---

## PRICING (2 minutes)

**Key Message:** Three payment options, 30-day guarantee.

**Say this:**
> "Three ways to pay:
>
> **Option 1:** $2,997/month for 3 months (standard)
>
> **Option 2:** $8,092 upfront - that's 10% off if you pay in full (saves you $899)
>
> **Option 3:** $4,496 now, $4,495 at Day 45 - splits it in half
>
> And we offer a 30-day money-back guarantee. If after the first month you're not seeing progress, we refund that $2,997. We've never had anyone ask for it, but it's there for peace of mind."

---

## NEXT STEPS (2 minutes)

**Key Message:** Decision by Monday to start next week.

**Say this:**
> "If you want to move forward, here's what happens:
>
> **Today:** You have questions, we answer them.
>
> **Tomorrow:** We send contract and details.
>
> **Monday (Feb 24):** You let us know - yes or no.
>
> **Tuesday:** If yes, we sign contract, you make first payment, we kickoff.
>
> **Wednesday (Feb 26):** Week 1 starts. We begin building.
>
> We can have your website live and LinkedIn pages set up by Week 2. First posts publishing by Week 4.
>
> But we need a decision by Monday to hit that timeline."

---

## CLOSING (2 minutes)

**Key Message:** Ask for the sale.

**Say this:**
> "So based on what we've shared - the problem, the solution, the ROI - does this make sense for Rhinestone?"

**[Wait for response]**

**If YES:**
> "Great. Let's talk logistics. Can you commit to 3 months starting next week? And can you dedicate about 30-60 minutes per week for reviews and engagement?"

**If HESITATION:**
> "What concerns do you have? Let's address them now."

**If OBJECTION:**
> [See objection handling below]

**If NO:**
> "I understand. What would need to change for this to be a yes?"

---

## OBJECTION HANDLING

### "We need to think about it"
**Response:**
> "Absolutely, this is a big decision. What specifically do you need to think about? Budget? Timeline? Proof of concept? Let's address those concerns now so you have what you need to decide."

---

### "Can you guarantee results?"
**Response:**
> "I can guarantee execution: 36 posts published, weekly reporting, all deliverables. What I can't guarantee is that you'll close X deals - there are too many variables I don't control.
>
> But here's what I know: Industry data shows that consistent LinkedIn activity + optimized profile + thought leadership content generates 5-10 inquiries per 100 followers gained. If you gain 500-1,000 followers, math says you'll get 25-100 inquiries. Converting even 2% of those to deals gets you profitable.
>
> Plus we have the 30-day guarantee - if you don't see progress, you get your money back."

---

### "That's expensive"
**Response:**
> "Compared to what? If you hired a full-time marketer, that's $4K-$6K/month plus benefits. If you hired a traditional agency, that's $5K-$10K/month. We're $2,997/month and you get AI-powered systems that work 24/7.
>
> But more importantly - if this generates even one client, it pays for itself 4x over. It's not an expense, it's an investment with a clear ROI."

---

### "We don't have budget right now"
**Response:**
> "I get that. When would budget open up? Is this a quarterly thing? Annual?
>
> Also - we have the split payment option. $4,496 now, $4,495 in 45 days. Does that help?
>
> Or here's another thought: If you close one deal in the next 30 days from your current efforts, use that revenue to fund this. Then we're building on momentum."

---

### "Can we see examples / case studies?"
**Response:**
> "Honest answer: You're our first employer branding client. We've built AI systems for other industries, but recruiting is new for us.
>
> That's actually why we're offering competitive pricing and documenting this as a case study. You're getting a discount because you're helping us prove the model.
>
> If you want an agency with 50 case studies, we're not it. But if you want cutting-edge AI, fair pricing, and a partner who's as invested in your success as you are - that's us.
>
> Think of it this way: You're getting the same quality you'd get from a $10K/month agency, at one-third the price, because you're the pilot."

---

### "What if it doesn't work?"
**Response:**
> "Define 'doesn't work.' If you mean we don't publish posts or build the website - that won't happen, we control that. If you mean you don't get followers - very unlikely with consistent content. If you mean you don't close deals - that's partly on the quality of your sales process, which we can't control.
>
> But here's the safety net: 30-day guarantee. After Month 1, if you're not seeing progress (follower growth, engagement, profile views trending up), we refund your money.
>
> And realistically - worst case, you still get a website, optimized LinkedIn, 36 pieces of content, and a documented case study. Even if you never close a client from it (unlikely), those assets have value."

---

### "We need to talk to our partner/board/advisor"
**Response:**
> "Makes sense. Who needs to be involved in this decision? Can we schedule a follow-up call with them? Or can we send them the proposal to review?
>
> What's the timeline for that conversation? We need to start by Feb 26 to hit the 90-day timeline, which means decision by Monday."

---

### "Can we do a 1-month trial?"
**Response:**
> "I understand the desire to test, but here's the challenge: Month 1 is foundation (website, LinkedIn setup, strategy). Month 2 is execution (content starts publishing, growth begins). Month 3 is results (momentum builds, leads come in).
>
> If we stop at Month 1, you won't see ROI - you'll just have a website and 4 posts. That's not enough to prove anything.
>
> What we CAN do is the 30-day guarantee: If after Month 1 you're not happy with the progress, we refund that $2,997. But you need to commit to 3 months so we have time to deliver results."

## CONFIDENCE BUILDERS

**If you're nervous, remember:**

1. **The problem is real** - They DO have zero digital presence
2. **The solution is proven** - LinkedIn growth works (industry data backs this)
3. **The price is fair** - $8,991 for 90 days is CHEAP compared to alternatives
4. **The ROI is clear** - Even 1 client makes them profitable
5. **The risk is low** - 30-day guarantee + they own all assets

**You're offering value, not selling snake oil.**

---

## FINAL TIPS

**DO:**
- ✅ Listen more than talk
- ✅ Ask questions ("What concerns you most about your current digital presence?")
- ✅ Be confident (you know AI, they don't)
- ✅ Be honest (admit you're their first recruiting client)
- ✅ Ask for the sale (don't just present and leave)

**DON'T:**
- ❌ Oversell ("You'll definitely get 10 clients!")
- ❌ Bash competitors ("Other agencies are terrible...")
- ❌ Get defensive (if they push back, stay calm)
- ❌ Lower price (they'll ask for discounts - hold firm)
- ❌ Leave without next steps
