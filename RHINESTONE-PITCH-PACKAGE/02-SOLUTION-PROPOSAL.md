# RHINESTONE RECRUITING - SOLUTION PROPOSAL
**90-Day Digital Transformation Package**

**Prepared for:** Rhinestone Recruiting  
**Prepared by:** Oybek & Said | AI Agency  
**Date:** February 17, 2026  
**Investment:** $2,997/month × 3 months = $8,991 total

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**The Challenge:**  
Rhinestone is selling employer branding services without an employer brand. Every sales conversation has a built-in credibility gap.

**The Solution:**  
Make Rhinestone your own best case study. In 90 days, we build a complete digital presence that proves you can do what you sell.

**The Outcome:**  
- Professional website + LinkedIn company page (foundation)
- Founder's LinkedIn transformed into thought leader platform (500-1,000 new followers)
- 36+ high-quality posts demonstrating expertise (consistent content engine)
- Documented case study showing measurable results (sales collateral worth $10K+)
- 1-2 new clients closed from LinkedIn activity (ROI positive in 90 days)

**Investment:** $8,991 total  
**Expected ROI:** 300-1,000% (based on closing 1-2 clients)  
**Timeline:** 12 weeks from kickoff

---

## WHAT WE'LL BUILD

### Phase 1: FOUNDATION (Weeks 1-2)

#### Deliverable 1: Professional Website
**What:** One-page authority website showcasing Rhinestone's expertise

**Components:**
- Hero section with clear value proposition
- Services overview (recruitment marketing, employer branding, personal branding)
- Founder bio + credibility markers (experience, approach, methodology)
- Contact form + booking calendar link
- SEO optimization (local search for "employer branding agency")
- Mobile-responsive design
- Hosted on professional domain (rhinestonere

cruiting.com or similar)

**Timeline:** Week 1-2  
**Platform:** Next.js + Vercel (fast, professional, scalable)  
**Design:** Clean, modern, brand-aligned (teal/silver/black color scheme from brand guide)

**Why This Matters:**
- Table stakes for credibility (93% of buyers research online before engaging)
- Gives LinkedIn profile/company page a destination to link to
- SEO foundation (will rank for brand name + key terms over time)
- Professional impression (vs. no website = looks like side hustle)

---

#### Deliverable 2: LinkedIn Company Page
**What:** Official Rhinestone Recruiting LinkedIn presence

**Setup Includes:**
- Company page creation + verification
- Banner design (brand-aligned graphics)
- Complete company description (optimized for search)
- Showcase pages for service lines (if applicable)
- Initial followers (seed with team + connections)
- First 4 posts published (introduction, services, founder spotlight, industry insight)

**Timeline:** Week 1  
**Ongoing:** 1 post/week after initial setup (12 posts over 12 weeks)

**Why This Matters:**
- LinkedIn is THE platform for B2B employer branding
- Company page legitimizes the business (vs. just founder's personal profile)

**Result:** Optimized profile that converts visitors to followers/leads

**Volume:**

- **Company Page:** 1 post/week × 8 weeks = **8 posts**

**Content Mix (Company Posts):**

- 30% Company culture (team, values, behind-the-scenes)

## APPENDIX: FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

**Q: Why should we choose you over other agencies?**  
A: Three reasons:
1. **AI-powered efficiency:** We generate content 10x faster than manual agencies, passing savings to you
2. **Recruiting industry focus:** We understand your market, speak your language, know your buyer
3. **Skin in the game:** We're documenting this as a case study - your success is our success

**Q: What if we don't get results in 90 days?**  
A: Define "results." If "results" = followers/engagement/content published, we guarantee it (we control those). If "results" = closed deals, we can't guarantee but can optimize for high probability. That said, our model assumes 1-2 deals close from LinkedIn activity - based on industry benchmarks, this is realistic.

**Q: Can you guarantee we'll get X followers or Y leads?**  
A: No agency can ethically guarantee specific numbers (too many variables: content quality, founder engagement, market conditions, LinkedIn algorithm). What we guarantee: Consistent execution (36 posts published), best practices (proven strategies), and continuous optimization (we adjust based on data).

**Q: What happens if LinkedIn changes its algorithm?**  
A: We adapt. Our strategy is platform-agnostic at core (build authority, create value, engage audience). If LinkedIn changes, we pivot tactics but principles remain. Worst case: We diversify to email, website SEO, other platforms.

**Q: Do we own the content you create?**  
A: Yes, 100%. All posts, articles, case study, methodology, website - you own everything. We retain right to showcase anonymized metrics in our portfolio, but all assets belong to Rhinestone.

**Q: What if our founder is too busy to engage daily?**  
A: That's a risk. LinkedIn rewards active users. If founder can't dedicate 15-30 min/day for engagement, growth will be slower. Alternative: Hire a VA to engage on founder's behalf (we can recommend providers). Or founder batches engagement (1 hour every Sunday for week's engagement).

**Q: Can you manage our founder's LinkedIn FOR them?**  
A: We can generate content and schedule posts, yes. We can suggest comments and DM responses. But founder must approve and ideally engage personally (authenticity matters). Think of us as ghostwriter + campaign manager, not impersonator.

**Q: Why 3 months minimum? Can we do 1 month trial?**  
A: LinkedIn growth is a 60-90 day game. Month 1 is setup, Month 2 is traction, Month 3 is results. If we stop at Month 1, you won't see ROI. We can do a 30-day satisfaction guarantee (refund Month 1 if not happy), but need 3-month commitment for results.

**Q: What's your track record? Can we see case studies?**  
A: Honest answer: You're our first employer branding client. (We've built AI systems for other industries, but recruiting is new vertical for us.) That's why we're offering competitive pricing and documenting this as a case study. If you want an agency with 50 case studies, we're not it. If you want cutting-edge AI + fair pricing + high-touch partnership, we're your team.

**Q: What if we want to cancel after Month 1 or 2?**  
A: You can, but you forfeit results. Month 1 = foundation (website, profile, setup). Month 2 = content + early growth. Month 3 = momentum + leads. Canceling early = wasted investment. That said, if we're truly not delivering, we'd rather know early and part ways amicably.

**Q: Can we see the AI-generated content before it posts?**  
A: Absolutely. Every post goes through approval workflow: AI generates → We review → You approve → Posts publish. You have final say on everything. (Over time, you may trust the system and approve in bulk, but initially, you see everything.)

**Q: Will this work for our specific niche (recruiting)?**  
A: Yes. Employer branding + recruiting is one of THE best verticals for LinkedIn. Your audience (HR leaders, talent acquisition, company founders) lives on LinkedIn. Content about hiring, culture, leadership resonates strongly. Industry data shows recruiting content gets 2-3x higher engagement than average B2B content.

**Q: What if we don't like the AI-generated content?**  
A: We iterate until you do. First week, we'll generate 10-20 variations and you pick favorites. We learn what you like, refine prompts, improve quality. By Week 3-4, AI should be producing content you approve 80-90% of the time with minimal edits. If we can't get there, we'll supplement with human copywriters (no extra charge).

**Q: Can we expand to other platforms later (Instagram, YouTube)?**  
A: Yes, but not in this package. This is laser-focused on LinkedIn (highest ROI for B2B). If LinkedIn works, we can expand to IG (visual content), YouTube (video thought leadership), Twitter (real-time engagement) in separate engagement. Focus wins.

**Q: How do we measure success week-by-week?**  
A: Weekly metrics report (emailed every Monday):
- Week 1-4: Foundation metrics (website traffic, profile views)
- Week 5-8: Engagement metrics (followers, reach, engagement rate)
- Week 9-12: Lead metrics (DMs, calls booked, proposals sent)
- You'll know if it's working by Week 6-7 (follower growth + engagement trends).

## CLOSING STATEMENT

**Rhinestone is at a crossroads.**

**Path 1: Status Quo**
- Continue selling employer branding without an employer brand
- Rely on personal network for leads (limited, non-scalable)
- Compete on price with freelancers ($1K-$3K/month)
- Struggle with credibility gap in every sales conversation
- Leave $50K-$100K+ on table annually (lost opportunities)

**Path 2: Build Authority**
- Invest 90 days building digital presence that proves expertise
- Become discoverable (LinkedIn, Google, industry conversations)
- Charge premium ($5K-$10K/month) backed by proof
- Scale beyond founder's network (inbound leads, referrals)
- Unlock $100K-$250K+ additional annual revenue

**The Investment:** $8,991  
**The Timeline:** 12 weeks  
**The Risk:** Low (refund policy, proven systems, transparent process)  
**The Upside:** 10-25x ROI if you close even 2-3 clients from LinkedIn

**We're ready to start Week 1 on Feb 26.**

**Question is: Are you ready to become your own best case study?**
