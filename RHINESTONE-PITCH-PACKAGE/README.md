## 💬 QUICK PITCH (30 Seconds)

If someone asks "What are you pitching Rhinestone?"

**Say this:**

> "We're helping Rhinestone solve a credibility problem. They sell employer branding services but have zero digital presence - no website, no LinkedIn, nothing. We're proposing to build their complete digital authority in 90 days using AI-powered content systems. Cost: $9K. ROI: If they close even one client from it, they get 4x return. It's basically using them as their own best case study."

---

## 🎯 KEY NUMBERS TO REMEMBER

**Investment:** $8,991  
**Timeline:** 12 weeks  
**Deliverables:** Website + LinkedIn + 36 posts + case study + methodology  
**ROI:** 4-10x (if they close 1-2 clients)  
**Their time:** 30-35 hours total (vs. 120-180 if DIY)  
**Guarantee:** 30-day money-back  

---

## ❓ LIKELY QUESTIONS & QUICK ANSWERS

**"Can you guarantee results?"**
→ "I guarantee execution (36 posts, website, all deliverables). Can't guarantee deals closed, but industry data says consistent LinkedIn = 5-10 inquiries per 100 followers. Plus 30-day money-back guarantee."

**"That's expensive."**
→ "Compared to what? Full-time marketer = $5K/month. Traditional agency = $10K/month. We're $3K/month. And if you close one client, it pays for itself 4x."

**"Can we see case studies?"**
→ "Honest answer: You're our first recruiting client. That's why pricing is competitive. You're the pilot. But we're using the same AI systems we built for other industries, just applied to your market."

**"We need to think about it."**
→ "Absolutely. What specifically do you need to think about? Budget? Timeline? Let's address those now."

## 🚀 CONFIDENCE BOOSTERS

**Remember:**
1. The problem is REAL (they have zero digital presence)
2. The solution WORKS (LinkedIn authority = proven strategy)
3. The price is FAIR ($9K for 90 days is cheap)
4. The ROI is CLEAR (1 client = 4x return)
5. The risk is LOW (30-day guarantee)

**You're offering value, not selling hype.**
